        <div id="content">
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 13">First Day! Got a tour of the office, started setting up dev environment, and ran through a few initial administrative things.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 14">Started suuuper early at the Eagle Pass Heli morning meeting. Cool to see a user with custom workflows, but also fascinating to see how much of their work is still offline. They were still reporting seasonal weather observations by hand with a chart on the wall, and most of their decisions were made offline just by breezing through the list of recent avalanches... Fascinating! I also finally got the dev environment up and running, but without a new-ish copy of the database! So that was cool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 15">Bit of a slow day after the long one yesterday, but I got a local copy of the database running (bit of a Postgres nightmare), finished the cybersecurity training, and started on my first project &#8212; adding server side validation of inputted data.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 16">Very short day, leaving early to get to Vancouver this weekend. Kept improving the validators, and ported this little record-keeping website over from my old SPIN work.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 20">Got the new computer all set up with the dev environment (much faster this time), and ticked off some administrative tasks. Checked in on Audrey regarding some Office 365 help (all resolved), and scratched the surface of the Avalanche Observation Validator class.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 21">Made a ton of progress on the Avalanche Observation validator! Finished as many checks as I could find, then had a code review with look and found some more having to do with what values an input can take based on some enumerations found elsewhere in the code base.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 22">Made a tiny bit more progress on the Avalanche Observation validator, but mostly spent the day at the Revy Tech Summit presenting on behalf of the CAA :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 23">Started working on a couple new tasks &#8212; handling validation errors in the UI, and documenting the submission of certain kinds of observations for CMH. Very buggy, slow, day, but I managed to stub out some solid progress right before leaving!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 26">Mostly just kept chugging on those validators... The UI bit that shows the validators as toasts is resolved, I think. So that's cool! And I'm probably 75% done with the Avalance Observation Validator.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 27">Slightly more exciting day than normal! I successfully helped someone recover a password in Outlook using my admin access, got all set up with a YM account, helped Kristin fix some quirky html-email problems, and then (finally) finished the Avalanche Observation Validator. Yay!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 2">Cranked out some more work on the Avalanche Observation Validator, shadowed Luke while he completed some of the ongoing monthly tasks, and had a good code review that indicated more work needs to be done on the validators :/ meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 3">Actually really productive! Got a ton of coding done on the validators. Nothing exciting, but just chugged through a lot of work that needed doing.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar5">Pretty productive half-ish day! Mostly worked on the ONeDrive issue on Emily's computer, but also cranked out a little of the validator stuff... Solid, but short!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 6">Not a wildly productive day, but hard to quantify. Started out wrapping up the Weather Observation Validator (although I haven't gotten to test it yet), and then spent the rest of the day reading docs and exploring the Photo Overlay tool! I took a lot of notes on what I think about it, and read a little into its documentations, and also took a look at what it's doing in the web inspector... Lots of thoughts for the future!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 7">Today was a little slow... Luke and I chatted a bit about AWS' hosting services and what's all in there. I'm actually writing this note 3 days late becasue I just found out that I skipped my notes on this day, and I can't remember very well what I did :| Bummer....</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 8">A pretty short day, but interesting! I went through and viewed almost every shot-sheet that's been submitted to InfoEx to see how people are currently using the photo overlay tool, and it's pretty fascinating. Took a lot of notes, and got some good ideas of what users are up to. Drew a few sketches for interface ideas, and called it a day at 2!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 9">Another short day, but pretty productive. Did a lot of work for Jill and Brent on some email templates that'll go out before the spring conference, and they seem pretty happy with the results. I also did a little searching into possible mockup tools for prototyping, but there's nothing good for free :/ Finally, I tracked down all the JS that's currently running the photo editor, so I've got some great leads on places to start hacking on Monday!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 12">Solid day rocking away at the photo overlay drawing tool! Worked very hard, but unsuccessfully to craft a way to test the drawing tool with local images (the images can't be returned as blobs from the server in the local environment). Also did some email template work for Jill et. al.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 13">Interesting day! Mostly spent working on the same local testing issue for the overlay tool and email template, but went out to RMR for a site visit in the afternoon! Collected some excellent observations by looking overy their shot sheets, which I think will make our final product much better. Not to mention, it's just so fascinating observing users... They do the darndest things!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 14">Short day :( left early with some kind of strange fever-y sickness. Nevertheless, made some progress on the photo overlay testing environment, and did quite a bit more email template work for Brent, Jill, Kristin, and Jill.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 15">Another short day of being sick :( Big event today was helping Kristin get the conference email invite sent out! I learned a lot about html emails and what css works or doesn't. The next release will be better!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 16">Productive day! Wrapped up 2 more email templates for Jill (hopefully YM doesn't ruin them), mostly finished a solution to the type checking errors that bubble up from the server during validation of observations, and got some good info to help me get started on documenting the hazard assesment and snowpack assesment workflow modules! Very solid!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 21">Short day... I am so stumped on this photo overlay task! The legacy code is just SO hard to read. It's almost like multiple versions were implemented, but only one is even used. It's like following the wiring in a booby-trapped house where half the wires don't actually connect to anything! Somewhat flustered, taking off early...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 22">Another short one, slightly more productive than the last! Still pretty stumped on that darn photo overlay code. I just can't seem to figure out how it's all working, and I'm very frustrated. Anyhow, I switched over to the validator-y stuff branch and tied that all up! Resolved a sneaky bug that I hadn't noticed before, and got a start on encrypting my hard drive which I've been putting off way too long.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 23">Intense day! Maybe I drank too much coffee. Finally realized it's time to just dive in and start creating some new files and classes to make this whole photo overlay editor work... Had a lot of little things pop up today, mostly with Emily and radios. Got a lot done, totally wired, kinda wish I could stay and work a little longer on the photo editor!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 24">Woo! Finally making some headway on the photo editor. Had the office all to myself, and got some very solid, serious programming cranked out. One of the most productive days I've had in weeks!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 3">First day back after a loooong bout of the flu! Hacked away at the photo overlay tool and made good progress. Go Ben.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 4">Started the day off with a site visit at Selkirk Tangiers, which was fascinating as always! One of the lead guides, Bob, spoke at leangth about how he doesn't really believe in the digital tools as he feels they get in the way of actually talking about the observations, and favour activities that work towards standardizing. S/T hates the bubbles! Other than that we had a staff meeting, and then I cranked out some more work on the photo overlay tool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 5">Drank coffee and got a whole lot of stuff done on the photo overlay tool! Mostly worked on getting the zoom functionality running while keeping the whole "canvas-y" vibe. Also, Luke and I met briefly about the validators and reviewed a pull request resulting in a list of to-do's for early next week.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 7">Such a meh day :/ just couldn't get my brain to get any work done, so I decided it'd be better to save the CAA money and head home. Was in the office around 2 hours... Ugh.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 9">Solid day! Felt nice to come back and actually get something done after Saturday :) (see above). Today, I worked almost exclusively on resolving the comments attached to the pull request for all the validator stuff. Additionally, however, I chatted with Luke about possible solutions to the buggy photo editor, met with Kristin/Brent/Andrea about the upcoming spring conference, and started researching better solutions to the buggy photo overlay photo loading software. Long day!</p>
