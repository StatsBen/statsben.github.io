        <h2>A daily record of Ben's work with the CAA in 2018</h2>
        
        <div id="content">
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 13">First Day! Got a tour of the office, started setting up dev environment, and ran through a few initial administrative things.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 14">Started suuuper early at the Eagle Pass Heli morning meeting. Cool to see a user with custom workflows, but also fascinating to see how much of their work is still offline. They were still reporting seasonal weather observations by hand with a chart on the wall, and most of their decisions were made offline just by breezing through the list of recent avalanches... Fascinating! I also finally got the dev environment up and running, but without a new-ish copy of the database! So that was cool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 15">Bit of a slow day after the long one yesterday, but I got a local copy of the database running (bit of a Postgres nightmare), finished the cybersecurity training, and started on my first project &#8212; adding server side validation of inputted data.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 16">Very short day, leaving early to get to Vancouver this weekend. Kept improving the validators, and ported this little record-keeping website over from my old SPIN work.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 20">Got the new computer all set up with the dev environment (much faster this time), and ticked off some administrative tasks. Checked in on Audrey regarding some Office 365 help (all resolved), and scratched the surface of the Avalanche Observation Validator class.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 21">Made a ton of progress on the Avalanche Observation validator! Finished as many checks as I could find, then had a code review with look and found some more having to do with what values an input can take based on some enumerations found elsewhere in the code base.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 22">Made a tiny bit more progress on the Avalanche Observation validator, but mostly spent the day at the Revy Tech Summit presenting on behalf of the CAA :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 23">Started working on a couple new tasks &#8212; handling validation errors in the UI, and documenting the submission of certain kinds of observations for CMH. Very buggy, slow, day, but I managed to stub out some solid progress right before leaving!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 26">Mostly just kept chugging on those validators... The UI bit that shows the validators as toasts is resolved, I think. So that's cool! And I'm probably 75% done with the Avalance Observation Validator.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 27">Slightly more exciting day than normal! I successfully helped someone recover a password in Outlook using my admin access, got all set up with a YM account, helped Kristin fix some quirky html-email problems, and then (finally) finished the Avalanche Observation Validator. Yay!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 2">Cranked out some more work on the Avalanche Observation Validator, shadowed Luke while he completed some of the ongoing monthly tasks, and had a good code review that indicated more work needs to be done on the validators :/ meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 3">Actually really productive! Got a ton of coding done on the validators. Nothing exciting, but just chugged through a lot of work that needed doing.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 5">Pretty productive half-ish day! Mostly worked on the ONeDrive issue on Emily's computer, but also cranked out a little of the validator stuff... Solid, but short!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 6">Not a wildly productive day, but hard to quantify. Started out wrapping up the Weather Observation Validator (although I haven't gotten to test it yet), and then spent the rest of the day reading docs and exploring the Photo Overlay tool! I took a lot of notes on what I think about it, and read a little into its documentations, and also took a look at what it's doing in the web inspector... Lots of thoughts for the future!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 7">Today was a little slow... Luke and I chatted a bit about AWS' hosting services and what's all in there. I'm actually writing this note 3 days late becasue I just found out that I skipped my notes on this day, and I can't remember very well what I did :| Bummer....</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 8">A pretty short day, but interesting! I went through and viewed almost every shot-sheet that's been submitted to InfoEx to see how people are currently using the photo overlay tool, and it's pretty fascinating. Took a lot of notes, and got some good ideas of what users are up to. Drew a few sketches for interface ideas, and called it a day at 2!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 9">Another short day, but pretty productive. Did a lot of work for Jill and Brent on some email templates that'll go out before the spring conference, and they seem pretty happy with the results. I also did a little searching into possible mockup tools for prototyping, but there's nothing good for free :/ Finally, I tracked down all the JS that's currently running the photo editor, so I've got some great leads on places to start hacking on Monday!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 12">Solid day rocking away at the photo overlay drawing tool! Worked very hard, but unsuccessfully to craft a way to test the drawing tool with local images (the images can't be returned as blobs from the server in the local environment). Also did some email template work for Jill et. al.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 13">Interesting day! Mostly spent working on the same local testing issue for the overlay tool and email template, but went out to RMR for a site visit in the afternoon! Collected some excellent observations by looking overy their shot sheets, which I think will make our final product much better. Not to mention, it's just so fascinating observing users... They do the darndest things!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 14">Short day :( left early with some kind of strange fever-y sickness. Nevertheless, made some progress on the photo overlay testing environment, and did quite a bit more email template work for Brent, Jill, Kristin, and Jill.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 15">Another short day of being sick :( Big event today was helping Kristin get the conference email invite sent out! I learned a lot about html emails and what css works or doesn't. The next release will be better!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 16">Productive day! Wrapped up 2 more email templates for Jill (hopefully YM doesn't ruin them), mostly finished a solution to the type checking errors that bubble up from the server during validation of observations, and got some good info to help me get started on documenting the hazard assesment and snowpack assesment workflow modules! Very solid!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 21">Short day... I am so stumped on this photo overlay task! The legacy code is just SO hard to read. It's almost like multiple versions were implemented, but only one is even used. It's like following the wiring in a booby-trapped house where half the wires don't actually connect to anything! Somewhat flustered, taking off early...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 22">Another short one, slightly more productive than the last! Still pretty stumped on that darn photo overlay code. I just can't seem to figure out how it's all working, and I'm very frustrated. Anyhow, I switched over to the validator-y stuff branch and tied that all up! Resolved a sneaky bug that I hadn't noticed before, and got a start on encrypting my hard drive which I've been putting off way too long.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 23">Intense day! Maybe I drank too much coffee. Finally realized it's time to just dive in and start creating some new files and classes to make this whole photo overlay editor work... Had a lot of little things pop up today, mostly with Emily and radios. Got a lot done, totally wired, kinda wish I could stay and work a little longer on the photo editor!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 24">Woo! Finally making some headway on the photo editor. Had the office all to myself, and got some very solid, serious programming cranked out. One of the most productive days I've had in weeks!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 3">First day back after a loooong bout of the flu! Hacked away at the photo overlay tool and made good progress. Go Ben.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 4">Started the day off with a site visit at Selkirk Tangiers, which was fascinating as always! One of the lead guides, Bob, spoke at leangth about how he doesn't really believe in the digital tools as he feels they get in the way of actually talking about the observations, and favour activities that work towards standardizing. S/T hates the bubbles! Other than that we had a staff meeting, and then I cranked out some more work on the photo overlay tool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 5">Drank coffee and got a whole lot of stuff done on the photo overlay tool! Mostly worked on getting the zoom functionality running while keeping the whole "canvas-y" vibe. Also, Luke and I met briefly about the validators and reviewed a pull request resulting in a list of to-do's for early next week.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 7">Such a meh day :/ just couldn't get my brain to get any work done, so I decided it'd be better to save the CAA money and head home. Was in the office around 2 hours... Ugh.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 9">Solid day! Felt nice to come back and actually get something done after Saturday :) (see above). Today, I worked almost exclusively on resolving the comments attached to the pull request for all the validator stuff. Additionally, however, I chatted with Luke about possible solutions to the buggy photo editor, met with Kristin/Brent/Andrea about the upcoming spring conference, and started researching better solutions to the buggy photo overlay photo loading software. Long day!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 10">Darn... I forgot to log this day, and coming back to catch up a few days late I'm struggling to remember exactly what I was up to. I think, mostly implementing a new solution to the photoEditor tool using the "sessionStorage" API, as opposed to the "message" API.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 11">Very productive day! Helped run the Skype-related stuff for the weekly meeting in which we chatted about the upcoming conference. I then resolved some really pesky bugs in the existing photoEditor.html file that allowed me to finally hit the ground running and implement the "zoom" tool for the new editor as well as get the "canvas" element up and running! Ended the day with beers with Kristin and Brent.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 12">A medium day... Resolved a few more issues in the validators, but started working on the error handler for invalid types on the server and the brain just isn't having it.... Headed out early, will tackle fresh with coffee another day soon!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 14">Kind of a meh day :/ Working a little slow, somewhat easily distracted. Anyhow, I worked on the issue with the validators when an incorrect type is submitted, and I just can't find a good solution to this issue where the handler is in one class that needs to be extended, but some of the validators extend another class... Arg :/ Such a big Java problem.... Implemented a hacky solution and upgraded some front end code for displaying the errors, but ultimately not too happy with the solution...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 15">SOLID day... Had the office all to myself and plowed through a solid chunk of the photo editor which is shaping up nicesly :) Made some excellent progress on the point marking tool. Woo!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 16"> Decent day :) Luke was back, which was a nice change of pace, and we managed to find a pretty solid solution for the issue on Apr 14th with the Spring extension class blah blah blah... And I implemented point marking in the shot sheet editor, yay!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 17">Got a lot done! Implemented a method to handle page resizes in the photo editor, finished up those sneaky validators, met with Luke about some development procedures n' stuff, and did a bit of email template work for Jill. Got a bit of a late start after thinking of a new idea for this time tracking stuff I'm doing here...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 18">A flurry of meeting activity prepping for the AGM, a burrito, and then nap time :/ meh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 19">A slightly shorter day, leaving around 1:30 for and apartment viewing. Started the day with a very uneventful online seminar about data security for non-profits that was waaaaay too basic :/ Also got the mouse interactions up and running in the shot sheet editor for avalanche drawing, though, so that's cool!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 20">Long day! Put in quite a few hours. Implemented a quick avalanche drawing tool, but then found a bug in the way that zoom offset was being calculated, so I spent a little too much time tracking that down :/ Met with Luke and Stuart, mostly chatted about the possibility of some charting tool changes, and eventually wrapped up the day with a last check on the validator pull request which should be all good to go now!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 21">Phew... This is a lot of days of work in a row... Nevertheless, I've finally resolved that darn stupid zoom offset bug in the shot sheet editor, implented a very simple avalanche drawing tool, and the first little sketchy bit of a "free-form draw" tool. Started early, leaving early. nice....</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 22">V short day, only 3 hours, but I cranked out some major progress on the shot sheet editor! I love having the office all to myself!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 24">Pew, pew! Killin' it today! Implemented avalanche colour coding, size and colour for free-draw, a hacky undo feature, added a Pusheen-y easter egg, and stubbed out a labelling tool for points. Awesome! This editor is really coming together!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 25">Ugh... No sleep, and no productivity. Got a little bit of work done adding ski cuts to the editor, joined in on the weekly meeting, and left the office early. Meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 26">Solid day! Biggest thing was sorting out all the tech setup for the AGM. Other than that, polished up a few things in the shot sheet editor and implemented the ski cut feature, and got a rudimentary version of point labelling up and running. woo!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 10">Phew! Finally back from the Spring Conference whirlwind tour! Had the 3 month review with Luke today, did some template work for Jill, and started working on connecting up the shot sheet editor prototype to the original code. Not too bad!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 11">A little on the short side, but reasonably productive. Finished another email template for Jill, reviewed some future work with Luke that I'll try to tackle while he's away, and (with some help from Luke) got the photo editor pulling up real InfoEx photos locally!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 14">Sloggy day... It's hot as balls in the office, and the brain is running slow! Anyhow, did a bit of email template work and resolved an issue with the FS object not being created becuase the Network.js file is so long that its ready function was being appended after that of other scripts listed much later in the html file. Meh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 15">Got the AJAX authentication working in the new photo editor! Wooooo... Also did a bit of email template work for Jill.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 16">Short day before heading out to meet Andrei, but got had the weekly meeting and then started doing a bit of work on the photo viewer, but there's a strange error coming up that I don't quite understand yet...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 17">Sloggy day... Brain not working well. Wrote a call-out for a mentor from the IT committee, kept hammering away at the photo viewing tool (with little success), chatted with Luke who's leaving soon, and went home a bit on the early side.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 18">Still running a little slow, but made some solid progress on the photo viewer so the sizing is optimized, and the thumbnails are more usable. Not too bad... It's real quiet in here...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 19">Blarg... Such a slow day! Brain not running right. Started working on the zoom tool for photo viewing, but it's just not going well. Many properties of the images just don't work as intended because of the way this window is hackily opened with no html... No serious progress.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 20">Got back from a run and saw some Mail Gun erros, so I popped over to Dose for some coffee and hopefully solutions! Submitted a trouble ticket per Luke's instructions, so hopefully that gets better. Started working on the photo viewer tool, and quickly realized that probably wasn't a great idea in a coffee shop where anyone can look over my shoulder... Meh, oh well. Later, at home, finished up the photo viewer. It's amazing what a change of space and some good coffee can do!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 22">Very blah day... Maybe still recovering from all the climbing yesterday. Anyhow, resolved an email about DNS stuff for caaml.org, caught up on email, made a pull request for the photo viewer work, and tried really hard ot get stuff done on the shot sheet editor but kinda floundered.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 23">Logging this a week later because I just realized this day was forgotten :/ bummer. But if memory serves I looked into some photo viewing for Stuart so he could respond ot a user inquiry, and set up things for the weekly meeting, helped Pam the printer lady do some work, and then I think I made a few hotfixes on the shot sheet editor based on conference feedback? hm...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 25">Just an hour of pesting Mailgun to do their job remotely...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 28">Slow day. Did a bit of work on the shot sheet editor starting to get the doodles to save, but realized there's some high-level thinking that needs to happen first about what reviewing those drawings will look like. Worked a little more on the ability to delete things from the shot sheets, but I'm getting a really weird but where functions 'don't exist' even though they totally do. Also tracked down some printer info because we need to re-open that trouble ticket, and did a bit more Mailgun pestering...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 29">Not a very productive day :/ Just not making headway on this photo editing stuff. Arg. Did some admin-esque work sorting Janis' Outlook account now that it's no longer needed, made a real quick email template for Jill, and... that's really about it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 30">Another meh day, but a bit more productive than yesterday. Attended the weekly meeting, and switched over to working on the pop-up history window issue which I'd say is a little over half resolved. There's a bit of odd stuff happening, but it's coming along nicely and should be done soon!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 31">Darn. Another slow one. Sorta made a bit of progress on the pop-up history window, but kinda just stared at the screen a lot... There must be dirt or sunscreen in my eye because I just can't keep it open, and that doesn't really help :/ Also had a quick chat with Kat about making some edits on the website, tried a bit of Audrey's tomato jam, and helped Andrea fix some titles in our YouTube videos from the recent conference. Not bad for a half day!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 5">Did some solid work on migrating the historical view pop-up system to the session storage API, but also helped update some errors in our private YouTube channel with a new video from Doug, consulted to Audrey about HTML emails in the "Events" part of YM, and also helped our renters figure out what's up with their internet and why it doesn't seem to work that well. Lots of interesting, little hurdles today!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 6">Finally figured a good way to re-write the historical view pop-up system... Really, all the JS in the report-window.html file should be in the report-window.js to ensure it all happens in the right order. Will adjust accordingly tomorrow! Also spent some time helping Susan with her excel spreadsheet for the CARROT meeting, fielded some questions from Scott Wickson over the phone, attended the weekly meeting, and consulted to Andrea about some email things (info@avass.ca).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 7">Shoot... Forgot to log this day so I'm coming back to it later and can't remember a lot. I think I kept working on the historical pop-up view... mm... darn. I have to log these things day-of!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 8">Another one I forgot to log. I remember being really zonked this day and feeling very sluggish and unproductive. I left early, it looks like, in my hours log.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 10">I get SO much done when no one is here (I mean, Myline was here, but it's different)! Cranked out some real solid work on the historical pop-up view, and left when I hit a road block. All the data timing is working now, but I've learned that JS can't modify elements on a "child window", so I'll need to do some brainstorming to finish this thang, which should be easier when Luke is back...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 11">LAYERS PANEL!!!! Best idea... How did I not think of this before! Note to self. OK, now for the log... Started switchiing over to work on the SWAG validations after putting the historical-view pop-up on hold, but have had nothing but problems. Database columns are missing, Hibernate and Beans are throwing exceptions, they're showing up as toasts but not in the console... OOof. Also warded off some potential cyber-security threats in the form of fake emails sent to Kristin and Joe and resurrected my lost Outlook calendar (finally!!!).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 12">Luke's back! Hooray! Spent the day working on the new layers panel feature idea. Stubbed some new classes and got the bare bones of a few UI elements up and running. Also had the party-planning committee meeting! That was cool! :D</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 13">Cranked away a bit on the photo editor. Solid! Weekly meeting, then party planning with Kristin. Birthday of Fernand Gonder is a go! Got Luke all caught up on the things, and updates! Re-writting scripts to support the switch to sessionStorage is a go, using 'hitRegion' API for the layers stuff, and maybe the newest version of Posgresql is the issue in running the global branch. Leaving at the end of the day with postgresql not working :/ ARG! BREW!!!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 14">Just wrestled with stupid, stupid postgresql all... Frickin... Day!!! Issues with brew, other package management software, etc. Eventually installed the stupid Postgres app and then hacked the last bits together. Kept getting hung up by forgetting to shut off the server before re-installing, and forgetting semi-colons at the end of PSQL commands... Meh, screw it. It's working now.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 15">Took off early to get away for some rock climbing with a rando' I found on the Stoke List! Spent the morning resolving the last couple Postgres issues, and got crackin' on the SWAG weather observation validator. Short and sweet!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 16">Worked a half day for the morning today before getting out for a long run in the afternoon. Just wrapped up the SWAG weather observation validator and did some top-secret party planning stuff! Pretty relaxed.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 17">Just a short few hours remotely from home. I switched over to the photo viewer upgrade branch to test what heppens when the thumbnails extend beyond the width of the window and improved the behaviour so they stack visibly on the screen. All this after resolving yet another postgres nightmare that occurred when I switched branches. Something about a role for Pascal that hasn't been created... Anyhow it's working again.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 18">Cranked out another validator! Woo! That's pretty boring work :/ Also did a bit of email template work for Jill, and some absolutely top-secret party planning stuff! (don't tell anyone...).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 19">Short day, had to run early to pick up the keg and other party stuff! Cranked out part of another validator, though. Solid enough.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 20">Finished another validator (woo!). Took the afternoon off to help Douglas move some equipment at Lower Mulvehill, then worked a couple hours from home in the evening debugging some validator stuff.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 21">MEETINGS DAY! Had back-to-back meetings, first about our plan for video stuff at upcoming CPD's and AGM's, second about what we're going to do when YM shits the bed again (happens so darn often...). Afterwards, consulted with Luke about how to resolve that sneaky validator bug, and he had some great ideas! Stubbed a solution, and left early for an afternoon of rock climbing.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 22">Very productive day! Implemented that new validator util method I stubbed out yesterday, and got about half-way finished with refactoring all the constants checks to utilize either the old or new util method as appropriate. Luke and I worked together for a few hours in the afternoon to hack together a solution to the report-hitory window pop-up thing and it's running! I don't know if I'm crazy about the idea of having functions as properties of an inline script in an HTML document, but it works so I'm satisfied!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 23">Volunteered with the LFI for a few hours in the morning, then worked the afternoon. Finished up with the validators (all are working now on the global branch), and went through the (now somewhat cumbersome) process of switching branches in hopes of potentially finishing the photo overlay drawing tool once and for all!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 26">Finally took a couple days off! Woo! Started trying to crank out the delte functionality in the shot sheet editor, and hit some blocks. Started implementing a solution, but getting a weird error... Calling it for today.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 27">Figured out the error from last night, and I guess the API we were hoping to use, and it's not actually supported in Chrome - it's in some sort of experimental state :/ Started reseraching the Path2D API as yet another workaround, but it's showing issues with transforming during zoom... We'll see what we can do!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 28">Did a bit of work on the photo editor, but got real tired at some point. Caught up on a lot of miscellaneous tasks that had piled up &mdash; schedule stuff, buttons for Kat, and designed a YM Emergency outage page.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 29">Cranked out some solid work on the photo editor! It now uses the Path 2D API :) Also added a bunch of contact info to the YM Emergency page. woo.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 30">Short day on a Saturday. Made some good progress on the photo editor, and added the last few contacts to the YM Emergency page</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 7">Just did a hot, fast hour of work on the YM Outage page and caught up on emails remotely from Wisconsin.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 9">First day back after the week away! Cranked out some solid work on the photo editor mostly. Getting the feature selection runnning for avalanches.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 10">About the same as yesterday, still cranking away at the photo editor!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 11">Just a half day before heading to Rogers with Niall. Almost entirely meetings, full staff, with Luke, and also a scrum with the whole InfoEx team.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 12">Lots of stuff happening today, impromptu meetins and tasks n' such. Did some email template work for Jill, edited our VCS procedures document, and worked on feature selection for avalanches. Pretty meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 13">Met with Luke and Stuart about low-hanging fruit in the InfoEx for summer work, and then resolved the lil' cursor bug in the feature selection for Avalanches. Eventually cracked a couple beers with Luke and Brent :) Solid.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 14">Half day extending the feature selection to points, nice and easy :) Also picked up beer for Luke.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 16">Cranked out feature editing for points, woo! Eventually faffed around a bit with Mercurial trying to fix the darn commit :/ blegh. Wrapped up with a tiny bit of email template stuff!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 17">Solid day! Got the feature selection stuff working for ski cuts, made some improvements to the drawing UX, transitioned to start a bit of work on the avalanche route control entry screen, did a bit of email template work, and co-programmed with Luke trying to get to the bottom of a very strange bug in the weather observation submission process.... Very mysterious!</p>
            <p clas="entry" date="July 18">Meetings day! And kind of a long one... Weekly staff meeting (nothing big), catch up with the whole IT crew (no new updates), then a catch up with Luke where we went over some big away-dates, some workflow things, and bounced a few ideas around about program-y ideas. Hammered away a bit in the afternoon at freezing the headers in the route control entry screen, but it got complicated :/ can't use 'position:sticky;' with 'display:table;'. Darn.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 19">Short day, headed to 'Merica this afternoon. Did some more research on pinning those headers, and might have a good JS solution. I'll try to hack it into place tomorrow! Also started working on HTML-ifying the ITP course certificates (sent a few emails and gathered a few of the graphics and assets from Brent). Not bad!</p>
            
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 31">Wow! I was gone a long time... Productive first day back, though! Stuck those headers in the route control entry (woo), sorted some version control stuff with Luke, and then got back to cranking on the photo overlay editor (SO CLOSE).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 1">Meetings, meetings, meetings, then back to the photo editor! Almost have the free-form draw tool running on the Path2D API (ugh... bugs), and Luke + I sorted out why my name appears as different people in the VCS. yay.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 2">Slooow day. But made some solid progress on the photo overlay drawing tool. yay. Just stuck with some confusion about reconciling the Path2D Context API with the current flow of data through the freeform drawing tool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 3">Weird day. Lots of stuff going on. Started out with a couple break throughs on the photo overlay drawing tool, but things started poppoing up and haven't stopped. Lots of things related to the printer, and some chatty Chathy's around the office. That too...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 6">Short day, just popped in after all the friends left for a few hours of work on the Photo editor. Got quite a bit done with no one else in the office, mostly finished the notes tool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 7">Hectic day, chatted a lot with Luke. Got a bit more progress made on implementing the notes tool but it's a bit buggy. Stayed very late trying to finish the notes tool, and as of leaving time it's pretty much there.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 8">Meetings, meetings, meetings. Also a short day, leaving a bit early for some climbing. Feeling very anxious and crunched for time. More photo editor work, but not wildly productive.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 9">Solid day! Co-programmed with Luke to get the images generated by the shot sheet tool saving to the server which is great. Our solution is v hacky, but works so I'm satisfied. This afternoon I did a bunch of polishing on the UI, fixed some bugs, and made some tweaks after watching Stuart interact with the tool. Very productive. It's amazing what 1 good night's sleep gets you...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 13">Mondays... Am I right? Actually, I'm logging this on Friday the 17th because I forgot to log work all week, and I can't remember what I did this day... Probably something av control related... Can't remember :/ probably something decent...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 14">Got driven totally insane by bugs and problems from the stupid av control entry issues, so switched branches to start picking some other low hanging fruit in the location status department... Read a bunch of code.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 15">Meeting day. Not super productive... Installed a new TV, hung out with people because TV... Got the darned lil' asterisk next to ob time running... That's about it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 16">V frustrating day, just kinda down for no reason. Super testy, and wanting to be stoked, but feeling very peeved by all the interruptions. Finally got the red highlighting for control team in the av control observation tool - took forever to figure out there was an issue with some dumb array indexed from 1 not zero... Meh, whatever. It's done! Going home!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 17">Downer dev day... Lame news on the car import front, lame news on the Jess front, feeling lame overall... ugh f it all. Got the attachments running for location status partially, but they just vanish upon submit. Sigh... Hate leaving this crap half funished, but I guess tomorrow-ben can deal with it...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 18">Arg.... Just can't figure out this stupid attachments widget! F it... Switched over to the photo editor and started InfoEx-ifying it, which is going alright but is proving to be a little tricky from a design perspective, as well as a tad buggy when generating heights n stuff...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 19">Had a great climbing session in the morning! :p worked a short day finishing inventory and Info-Ex-ifying the shot sheet editor. Short n sweet.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 20">Wasn't planning to work today, but when I stopped by the office to grab my computer the phone was ringing and I answered it :/ Oh well. Just 2 hours of so of helping Scott with some YM crap and tyding my local repository space.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 21">Everything is exploding! Not really, just had a lot of miscellaneous urgent requests for bug fixes that took up the whole day. Not an efficient development procedure... Oh well. Day complete!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 22">Frustrating day! Just lots of interruptions - hard to really get a lot done. Knocked off one more bug that Stuart and Luke found, and resolved two more small low-hanging-fruit - one of which turned out to just be a one liner :) Day complete!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 23">Meh... Knocked out the darn attachments in the Workflow Module, Run List thing with Luke in the morning! Glad I asked for help on that one... Probably wouldn't have solved it alone for a long time. Resolved two smaller bugs, but when reviewing one with Luke and Stuart the scope has expanded... Drastically... I really think we need to study this problem a bit before dumping a bunch of hours into whipping up some feature that may or may not solve the problem. Really wish we had an HCI budget :/</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 24">Arg... Trying to catch up on logging after the weekend and I can't remember :/ darn... Probably a bit of HTML stuff for Emily that I thought was happening today, but is actually next Friday? mmm... darn.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 27">Meh... Short half day, and not super productive... Just sort of probing around in the Run List settings code but I don't fully get it yet... Spent a lot of time in the Chrome de-bugger trying to find out where the 'config' object comes from...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 28">Solid day, I think I really understand the Run List settings code, and I've made some good progress on adding in the comments box settings. Seems like the settings I add are being stripped out of the JSON somewhere, though... To the debugger!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 29">Productive day! Got some help with Luke in tracking down why my new Run List settings weren't being applied, and I'm a complete idiot... My code has been running for at least a day, there's just a tiny hidden "save settings" button I had never found!! Anyways, it's resolved, and I cleaned up the branch :) </p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 30">Meh day :/ came in after a good breakfast, though! Got a little start on adding photos to the run list view, but mostly got distracted chatting with Luke about #metoo. haha. One of those days...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 31">Short day, leaving early to prep my house for my parents' arrival :| caught up on some logistics around the office (making sure my hours are counted correctly after stat holidays), did a bit of HTML work for Emily to improve the Level 2 Course Reg page, and then hopped on a little bit of work in the Jira low hanging fruit department.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 4">Back at it for an afternoon of codin' on the photo inlay thing! Short, uneventful.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 5">Chugging away on the photo inlay tool which is tricky and buggy... Realized it would require some major changes to the 'Photo Viewer' widget, which then led into Ecclipse Hell trying to reconcile changes in this branch with the old photo viewer changes branch and did a series of complicated and frustrating merges... barf. Also had a bunch of problems with photos serving locally :( arg.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 6">Lots o' meetings, generally... Got photos serving locally, hooray! Stupid Tomcat... Eventually found what the bug in the photo viewer was and got it linked into the tool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 7">Finished making a minimode for viewing photos in the run list module and got it all hooked up! It's just got one bug now, the photos are the wrong size initially upon loading but resolves after zooming once... Meh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 8">Scope change :\  ch ch ch ch ch ch changeeeees... Photo viewer should look different, changing them now. Basically re-implementing the minimode again. So many times :'( Got butter chicken, had a good idea on the html-ification of the ITP certificate, registered for a Level 1 course, and consulted Kristin and Andrea about HTML email stuff briefly.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 10">Variety day! Arrived to email from Stuart about a bug and did some investigating in hopes of providing him with more details, helped Jill forward along some HTML email stuff to Arc'teryx, consulted with the email crew briefly, worked a bit on the ever changing photos in the runlist thing, found some interesting reading on web-app infrastructure that I read because it seemed relevent to our work, and did some reading in the Interaction Design book about UX research in an Agile style that was encouragin-ish...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 11">Lots of things today! Seems like the Membership Services crew + Jill + Brent are working real hard on improving the html email workflow, which is good! Had a couple surprise meetings with them, and I've mostly interfaced with Brent who seems to be on the same page about all of it as myself. Also did a bit of HTML de-bugging for Emily who was updating some course info on the website. I think I found the source of the bug in the photo inlay thing - the size from which the photo dimensions are being computed is undefined at the time of execution... Started working to resolve this but got a headache and didn't get much done :( lol</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 12">Funky day - resolved that darned bug in the photo inlay thing! Amazing what a freshly caffeinated brain can do. Operated the increasingly complicated tech for the weekly meeting. Got sucked into some HTML email meetings. Consulted Audrey on some YM issues and submitted a trouble ticket on her behalf. Ultimately got sucked into BitBucket merging hell with VIMdiff for the last hour and a half - not sure any of that even worked...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 13">Solid Thursday! Luke was back and pretty busy. Got some help from him on the BitBucket merging hell :/ Also did some email template work, and attempted to install some software on Emily's computer in the afternoon but had some issues with the serial number :/ Had some last final consultations with Brent about the email templates and started implementing what should be the final email template! Left a little early to pick up a mattress.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 14">Long day! Mostly email template implementation stuff, and also some chitter chattering with Luke... Near the end - worked with Luke to resolve an issue about windows closing after opening different attachments in the run list view - turned out to be a one liner! Had to wade through a bit of Mercurial Hell to get the changes pushed, though, arg... Finally got all upgraded to TomCat v9 just before leaving - a little on the late side!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 15">Pleasant afternoon :) Wrapped up the end of the first of 6 email templates (the rest should be largely copy and paste from here). Resolved an HTML content bug for Emily.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 17">Solved the pesky sizing bug for photos inlaid on the runlist screen, and identified the "highlight" function where the photos will be changed :) Holding off to tie it up until I can double check with Luke about the functionality. Also finished the ITP certificate html-ification! yay!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 18">Got a fair bit done! Reviewed the new ITP certificate with the relevant folk - now need to link it up to real data with some help from Audrey. Double checked the functionality of the runlist photo overlay and it's 99% done, but the location UUID isn't accessible from the 'focus' method! :'( Also got a solid start on viewing photos from the location catalogue, but again, can't access the location UUID from where I need it. Gotta come back to this stuff with a fresh brain... schmarg...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 19">Short day - sent Jess off to Van around 2:30. But I solved those pesky bugs and wrapped up the last few details on the photos viewing in the location calatogue, and the photo inlay in the runlist thing. Those should be done now, pending testing!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 20">Back at that frustrating part of the design curve - getting familiar with existing infrastructure :/ started working on our proposed solution for the pdf shot sheet stuff - that is displaying some route control data along with photo overlays in the photo overlay viewer. Started stubbing some UI stuff... not much going on!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 21">Even shorter day! Off to Whis this afternoon. Not super productive - just kind of caught up on communication a bit and fumbled around with the PDF generation solution. Not super productive, really...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 26">Back to the grind! Busy day. Passed those final HTML email templates back and forth a bit, responded to the 80+ unnread emails, attended a couple meetings, completed the cyber security online training, responded to an email about the training from Emily, and suddenly it was 5pm and that's that :/ </p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 27">Wowzers... Things are really picking up around here with winter fast approaching! I got a solid chunk of UI development done this morning on the PDF shot sheet stuff. This afternoon has been a bit hectic, though. Worked on some seriously pesky bugs that are appearing in some older email clients, helped re-install Skype for Emily (it wasn't working at all), started taking over a couple tasks for Luke (who's even more swamped!) like installing Skype on a number of computers and prepping a meeting room tutorial for a future weekly meeting.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 28">Crazy day! So much stuff going on... After being away from the office for a long chunk around lunch it wound up only being a 5-ish hour day :/ Buuuuut! Finalized that email to staff following up on the security training stuff, found out why it's so darn hard to get those image dimensions in the shot sheet viewing UI (timing issue), and weathered this whole Kavanaugh storm with Luke.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 1">Blarg, so much stuff happening! Got some good UI work done on the overlay viewer this morning (solid), then just kind of got caught up in the office for the rest of the day :/ chatted with Luke (ugh... fucking Kavanaugh), helped unload books, got on the phone with Office 365 for a while, sent some test emails, chatted with Brent about a last few email template buggos, consulted Kristin about carrots vs. cupcakes for Emily, and removed a large moth larvae from the office.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 2">Wowzers... So much office support... Lots of YM trouble, helped Audrey a bit with computer stuff, wrote some Slack tutorial emails, installed Slack on a few peoples' computers, tried to get Slack to start up automatically on those computers, did some HTML email work for Jill, proof-read a letter from Luke to YM, and did a tiny amount of InfoEx development :/</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 3">Dang.... What a day. Seemed like meetings straight from 10 to 3:30. Did the usual weekly at 10 that included surprise demands from Emily about recording the staff meeting and mixing together a happy birthday tape for Joe. After, got a meeting rearranged so we could sit in on a recap of what's going on with the learning management system which is a big, complicated pile of interpersonal problems... Followed that up with a meeting with Kristin about the same thing for a while... Caught up on email about the HTML email stuff for a half hour and then back into meetings about the $30,000 LMS stuff. Then did some server work in the basement with Luke. Then had to head out early to let Jess into the house :/ the end... </p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 4">'Nother one a those busy ones... Did some scramble-y HTML work as the membership team hammered out their design, did a bit more thinking on the LMS stuff with Luke and Kristing, integrated that ITP certificate into YM mostly, and some other miscellaneous things...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 5">Finally some InfoEx work! Made some decent progress on the PDF shot sheet stuff - resolved a sort of bug or problem with photos not loading at the right time for some UI elements to generate. Staff went to the coaster, that was fun! And ultimately stubbed some notes for future work on the PDF shot sheet stuff. Solid enough!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 9">Mostly code reviewing... Felt kinda busy in spite of there really not being a ton to do :/ maybe that's just recovering from the weekend. Regardless, looks like a bunch of new branches are ready to be shipped out tomorrow, yay!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Octover 10">Meetings day! </p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 12">A very tired and blah Friday. Worked on some YM issues through a lot of the morning (HTML emails, the ITP certificate which has proven to not be possible with our current methods, and automating Audrey's Excel processes). Afternoon was spent doing some doggedly slow programming in an effort to solve some bugs in the default branch that appeared after merging the whole summer's work.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 15">So little work today :/ schedule conflicts, long dentist appointment, and a trip home to sit on the phone with IcelandAir for ages... Eventually did some programming on those bugs but realized I was confusing the overlay viewer with the photo viewer! Made some dumb changes in the wrong place only to be rolled back, and realized a proposed solution from work doesn't seem to work :'( </p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 16">Still a little preoccupied with all the travel planning stress - even had to leave for an hour in the middle of the day for frustrating Iceland Air crap... Anyhow, somewhat productive! Resolved 2 more small bugs in the latest InfoEx commits, helped Jess move a cabinet, had some classic Luke chats, discussed some digitized process improvements for Jess, and handled some misc. IT requests (Office 365 stuff w/ Jess n' Stuart).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 17">Meeting day! Got a fair bit done, though. Installed Slack with a lot of people, thought of some good HCI ideas with Luke n Stuart (surveys!), did some HTML email work, and managed to be heading out around 4:30!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 18">Dev day, and crushing it! Finally took a detailed trip through the photo viewer with the debugger and found the root of all these new bugs. Solved it all with some good refactoring, and it's running now! Took a crack at the new save+done button issue, but we agreed the solution kinda sucks :/ so it'll get redone... Found another bug in the photo viewer (zoom button is <i>too</i> fixed), and will work on that too!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 19">Short day before heading off to Lake Louise... Honestly, I forgot to log this before leaving, and now that it's been almost a week I can't really remember what I did. Ah farts...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 23">Made today an office/IT day with good success! Got those tutorials ready for tomorrow's meeting and did some fairly major HTML Email work, and that is pretty much resolved now :) yay.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 24">Meetings day... Not super productive. Did some good research on the Excel Macros work - got some detailed notes on Jess' process and started to implement some first solutions for Audrey, although I'm a little confused so far. Hopefully it'll start to come together with a bit more work. Also consulted with Luke about some upcoming meetings, conducted the training in the weekly staff training, debugged this work log thing, and took off a tad earlier than normal for a run :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 25">Bit of a slow brain day - kept chugging on the PDF shot sheet stuff with some success. </p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 26">A fairly productive dev day... Started to continue work on the PDF generation stuff, but found a bug in some of the merged shot sheet editor code that needed to be fixed first (so I could draw shot sheets for PDF). Worked slowly, and painfully through that whole process, and eventually got it running (yay!). Once that was done, kept making progress on linking up the pdf generation stuff with some success.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 27">Went in planning to work a full day, but the weather turned so nice I ditched early... Regardless, made some progress on the PDF generation stuff until a strange bug blocked progress (some things come up undefined in console logging but not when stepping with the debugger). Finished up by resolving a bug Stuary reported in the runlist module where comment boxes defaulted to weird, useless sizes...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 28">Super short day working from home (don't want to interrupt Myline!), just resolved a bug I found the other day in the Shot Sheet Editor, caught up on this work log, and wrapped up an email to staff recapping the meeting room training.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 29">Kind of meh day :/ was hoping to get some help from Luke on a development problem I'm a little stuck on, but unfortunately he's away for a family emergency. Worked for a while on Andrea's computer which had some fairly catastophic failures - unfortunately I couldn't resolve the issues but will try to get the ball rolling on maintenance after a quick consult with Luke tomorrow!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 30">Pretty solid day! Got some fairly major work done on the PDF shot sheets phase one with help from Luke (ticked off steps up to creating a look-up table of human-readable names for fields, as well as loading associated observations). Took off a tad early to get a quick run in while the nice weather persists :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 31">Kept chugging along on the pdf viewing stuff (data is now pruned and displayed). Began further work on smart photo sizing, but got confused and mired down :/ Also conducted the weekly meeting tech, installed Slack with Jill, performed a code review for Luke's pull request, attempted to clean Emily's laptop fan with compressed air, and met briefly with Luke and Stuart to talk about upcoming plans and current work!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 8">First day back after being gone a while! A little out of it and not very productive, but I did I did manage to catch up on a lot of email and start sorting out some unresolved issues. Tackled a few HTML bugs for Andrea, resolved an issue Jamie was having with MS Word, chatted a bit with Luke via Slack, and helped Jess with some scanner stuff. That's about it!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 9">Lots to do around the office including bits of HTML this n' that, some mysterious emails from Emily, and a little bit of off and on development that wasn't super productive, but oh well.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 11">Took a while to get wired, but I eventually made some important discoveries about those pesky bugs with the runlist photo viewer! Got them largely resolved, but eventually got stuck on what seems like a timing issue... Debugger reports the image's height is zero at the time the function 'resize' is getting called, but that doesn't seem right... meh, screw it!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 12">Deeper down the rabbit hole! A very productive dev day. Immediately solved yesterday's problem with a fresh brain after some sleep, but ivestigating Stuart's reported issue with the comment boxes revealed some more issues with the photo viewer, in addition to some errors that occurred for the "vertical" version of the photo viewer that were either caused by the addition of those "Save+Done" buttons or maybe the refactoring I did in the widget yesterday... Anyhow, I fixed it all and I'm headed home! Hungry!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 13">A collection of little this n' thats. Addressed some of Stuart's comments on the shot sheet editor, resolved a bug in the photo overlay viewer, investigated a couple other comments from Stuart but decided I actually think they're likely good-to-go as is, and I also followed up on a couple other errors I couldn't reproduce (although they might be user errors I too made while developing). Also did a bit of HTML email work for Andrea, debugged some HTML for emily, and consulted with Brent briefly about Canmore CPD videos.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 14">Such a wednesday... Facilitated tech for the weekly meeting, met remotely with Luke, worked a little on the PDF shot sheet viewer stuff, got sidetracked helping Kat with some Excel troubles, spent some time addressing a few miscellaneous SharePoint conerns that took a little longer than I expected, got roped into helping Jess move part of the massive, heavy backlog of shipments to the no-longer-striking post office, helped Audrey and Kat with some computer case stuff, and investigated what's going on with the attachments made in the runlist view... hm...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 15">Slow brain day, but finally got over a couple hurdles! Spent a good chunk of the day trying to figure out why those attachments from the runlist view weren't saving. Took a while, but I found 1 line of JS was missing! Also helped install Slack with Brent (again?) and made some mixed progress on the PDF viewing stuff. It's now displaying info for the other observation types, which is cool, but the UI isn't responsive to wide images and it's driving me nuts. So stumped. hm...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 16">Long one! Just had some stuff pop up near the end of the day. Mostly dev today, I finally finished that pdf shot sheet viewing stuff, I think! It's responsive, finally... I merged it into default. I also compiled a long-ish and pretty comprehensive update of everything I've been up to for Stuart and Luke, and also tried to field a support call about the weather station stuff (which was mostly just passing that support along to Luke and Stuart :/ haha).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 17">Meh... Responded to some emails and wrapped up the chain about MoT weather stuff with Jeff not Jess. Started working on adding a NiVis page but just couldn't really get in the zone today. Ah well!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 19">Short day after getting hung up in the auto shop in the morning - also had a lot of pop-ins at the office today. Audrey's GMail account is receiving some massive Spam Bomb kind of cyber attack, Todd was in and chatting about computer mice, Jess was having a bit of computer trouble that resolved itself, and Andrea had some YM Email breakthroughs she was excited to tell me about (they're good). Also had some pop-up debugging to run through for Stuart as well as a lot of email to catch up on. Couldn't quite resolve the Save+Done buttons in the workflows stuff (although I see what the problem is), and I found another but on the photo viewer (UUUGGGHHHH!!!!) I'm going to home to sleep for a long time.... Mondays, am I right??</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 20">Finally got into the zone today! Resolved a number of bugs today like more bad sizing in the photo viewer for runlists, a bug in the zoom buttons in the regular photo viewer, and a sizing issue in the photo viewer for vertical thumbnails, as well as a bug in the photo overylay discard button, re-implemented the zoom interaction in the shot sheet editor, and added the Save+Done buttons into the route control workflow module. Also consulted Audrey on her ongoing email troubles, chatted with Joe about laptops, and consulted with Andrea about some more upcoming HTML issues. So productive!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 21">Short day. Facilitated the weekly meeting tech, helped Jess move some stuff to the post office that's apparently no longer striking, resolved a bug in the shot sheet editor, resolved a bug in the photo overlay viewer date region, and started trying to figure out why old photo overlays don't show related observation data... Puzzling!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 22">Frickin' Harold... Comes home after the bar closes and makes a bunch of racket... 4 hours of sleep, ugh F this... Anyhow, a reasonably productive day - most of which was spent figuring out why old shot sheet details wouldn't render (now resolved), and the rest was spent resolving a number of smaller bugs like the new Shot Sheet editor zoom buttons, Shot Sheet editor default zoom. Also added some outstanding issues to Jira. Headed home early to prepare for the arrival of the parental units!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Nomvember 23">A very short, but very productive day! I hammered out two crucial bug fixes for the next release that I thought would be pretty challenging, but worked out OK in the end :) Heading home early for Thanksgiving dinner with the folks - I think I actually finished everything I needed to get done for the next release! Go Ben...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 26">Wow, what a day! Had some more-complicated-than-usual bug reports to sort through in the morning, just making sure I understood what the desired behaviour was and how it was failing. Looks like I've got 3 issues to fix sooner than later. Andrea's laptop broke again, but I was able to fix it! Slightly time consuming. Pat from Lake Louise also called today to report some bugs and seek some help - I was eventually able to pass those on to Stuart. In the afternoon I gave an InfoEx tutorial to Sabina, which required that I study the help docs a little while in the morning. That actually went pretty well in the end. Yay! No dev work at all today, though... So many things popping up, many from outside the office!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 27">Soooo quiet compared to yesterday, only two tiny HTML issues came up from YM and I was able to solve them both really quickly. Otherwise, I updated the default comment box sizing, got to the roote of the run-list photos in a new window problems (pretty sure), and took a first crack at making the file sizes on the photo overlays much better. Got a lot of dev done! Oh, and I helped Walter fix his email app :) </p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 28">Meeting and dev day! Luke's back, which is nice :) Things are picking up. Worked on some of the latest bugs, and tried to give Luke a hand with things. Made a release to QA... That was new.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 29">Kind of a fart of a day... Didn't sleep well, had some urgent validation bugs to fix first thing, spilled coffee EVERYWHERE... and then I resolved a bug or two and went home.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 30">Nice short day :) I'm over hours, but came in to hammer out another couple bugs for the big release we hope to do Monday. Solved the last 2, and then tried to do some haphazard testing of all the recent work with Luke for a little while... Solid Friday!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 3">Kind of an intense day... Just working through a tough bug with Luke where adding multiple attachments creates multiple observations in the database. Also sorted a bug or two of my own, like linking to image icons in spite of URL parameters. Kind of a short day.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 4">Hacked away on some small bugs, and then did some work on setting the default size for the photo overlay viewer that feels hacky and half baked. Figure the release is ready to go tonight, so that's cool. Spent the afternoon taking a look at the list of work in the new sprint. meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 5">Meh... Wednesday. Lots of updates and misc. office stuff in the weekly meeting. Wrapped up one bug found by users in the new release we put out last night, which was efficient but probably would have been best caught before the release :/ but that's OK! Otherwise, just started scraping away at the new set of work!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 6">Pretty pleasant and uneventful dev day! Ticked off one new issue, and started on another with a bit of help from Luke. Also got a report of another bug in the latest release... Added a ticket and will resolve soon :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 7">Kept hacking away at another little feature improvement, but the rabbit hole is a bit deeper than I expected on this one :/ Diving into some servier changes and some not-small client hacks. It's working, but this feels like a big chunk to have bitten off. I'll likely be leaving it unfinished for the weekend.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 10">Back from a wild weekend, and actually got a fair bit done! Tackled 3 bugs, resolved the outstanding VCS hell from Friday, helped Jess with some MS related troubles, and did a bit of HTML email work for Andrea. All in a day's work.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 11">Solid dev day! Hacked through a few more old bugs, and also resolved the server side of that issue from yesterday. Meh, productive!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 12">Skied the morning, that was nice :) Staff meeting was good, we looked at the new expense policy, took a staff photo, and got some Christmas presents. Spent the afternoon hacking on more bugs... bugs, bugs, bugs... Oh my! Late-ish evening too.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 13">Intense day of debugging - just had to hack together a soloution to some of those irritating bugs in the darn run-list photo viewer. Tried to make some smart refactors to make the code less heinous, but it didn't work :'( Frustrating. Anyhow... Also set up a new monitor and Brent's computer, helped Jess with some tech difficulties around screen sharing, and resolved one of the new Jira tickets for the new sprint. So that's nice :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 14">Did some debugging... fixed some more stuff. Did some work on InfoEx generated report emails. Seemed to go well enough....</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 17">So tired... Want nap... Extreme exhaustion. Weird day. Sent some long emails this morning, scheduled a meeting with my new mentor, unpacked and distributed some new computer monitors, redistributed some old computer monitors with Luke, reviewed some potential LMS contracts for Emily (will report tomorrow), started to take a look at annual review stuff but was interrupted by another bug in the shot sheet editor... Feeling very flustered about all the shot sheet editor bugs... hermph.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 18">Worked a bit from home while sick :'( mew...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 19">Started late, still recovering from the sickness... Worked a bit on those report emails, ran tech for the weekly meeting, did the final updates to Brent's computers, had the annual review, and finished the report email work after a bit of a scope change.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 20">Sort of a rocky day, found out I made an error when committing last night and put up the wrong file so I had to re-apply a bunch of changes on the PDF email work... Not a huge deal. Also, I guess Luke and I weren't on the same page about what setting up Brent's new laptop entailed, so that caused problems (additionally, something I did was wrong and caused the accidental deletion of a bunch of SharePoint files that were subsequently recovered - not sure what was the issue, though). Got a terrible, horrible headache around lunch time. Did some more work on Brent's laptop per Luke's feedback, also reviewed some upcoming work with Luke, resolved a Jira ticket, and worked through a number of hoops with Luke to test it on another computer. What a fart.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 21">Another day of developin'. Did some work to get switched over to an International development environment and started working away on a couple more Jira issues. Need Luke to push some of his changes before I can do some of the work I need to, so in a hloding pattern there... Meh. Long week. Stoked to not work a little while.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 28">Pretty pruductive for a first day back after being away a little while! Knocked out most of one outstanding Jira ticket and half of another. Pretty solid, just chugging along!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 29">Ticked off 3 bugs today! Some have been nearly done for a while, but still. One was tricky, and I guess I solved it somewhat randomly... Some CSS just hadn't been created for some UI elements that were added to accomodate SWAG reporting, and I stumbled upon that oversight quite randomly... Anyhow, it's solved now, woo!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 31">Short but solid day, although Ivan's Georgian wine didn't make the morning any easier... Anyhow, knocked out a mildly complicated bug and started looking into the biggest Jira ticket of my current sprint which is fairly intimidating... hm...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 2">Meh... Bit of a blob today, just feeling off. Did some decent development work, though, and made solid progress on two of the more substantial bugs in the current sprint. Also had a lot going on with meetings, Brent's new computer, Andrea + email stuff, and so on. Anyhow, survived it!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 3">Outside of work, today was a fart. But oh well. Got a late start, kept working on location photos, which had a lot of problems, but I eventually wrapped up the server side around 3. Had a long Skype with my new mentor, and then worked on a bit more of the front-end stuff to go along with the location photo work. Meh. At least it's over.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 4">Got wired this morning and tacked 3 more Jira issues, finally flying! Also did some InfoEx support trainig with Stuart in the aftternoon, and responded to some calls from SME. Solid.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 5">Meh... Wracked my brain almost all day about these reverse calculations to determine output image size and default line width to make all the strokes and text the same in the shot sheet editor, but I basically just wrote and re-wrote the sme few lines over and over with the math never quite working out... Must have needed a nap.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 7">Got a lot of dev done today! Solid. Found and resolved a couple bugs as I kept chugging on the Shot Sheet Editor, also finally made some smarter progress on the text-size stuff. It's getting there, although now Im pretty stuck on the points... They just don't look right, but it's hard ot tell why...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 8">Frustration... Just can't get the math on these darn computations to work out so all the output photo overlays are the same size with identical font sizes and stroke widths! Balls... Much frustrate... I keep thinking I'm close but it doesn't work... It's a moving target, or like a goat that's eating itself - a circular paradox with no end and no beginning... Ah well. Maybe it'll make more sense when I'm back with fresh coffee tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 9">Worked it out in the end! Finally got to the bottom of that pesky sizing bug I've been working on for a few days, which took most of the day, but now things are flying by. Also had the weekly meeting in Kristin's office this week. Anyhow, headed out to the Coast for a few days! Solid enough!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 15">Spent a while this morning catching back up to speed on everything that's gone on since I was away, then did a little bit of development polishing up that work on shot sheet compression, and then spent the afternoon reviewing/testing work from the latest sprint! wooo...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 16">Weekly meeting, and then kept polishing away in preparation for the new release. Spent a big chunk of the afternoon reviewing code and testing with Luke, which went well! Still a couple lil' things to wrap up, but hopefully this'll all be passed over to Stuart by the end of the day tomorrow!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 17">Spent the morning hacking away on some of those last few pieces for the upcoming release that appears to be on shcedule. Luke and I reviewed and tested some of that together with the local-ssl-proxy tool. A big chunk was implementing a zoom button for the photo overlay viewer. Spent the afternoon doing a code-review of Luke's work for the latest sprint... So much repetitive Java... So boring... Very hard to stay awake. No real criticisms, though, and i managed to mostly read it all...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 18">An action packed day! Reviewed yesterday's code review with Luke, we released the newest version to QA, we reviewed the upcoming sprint, and reviewed some of the tech side of supporting InfoEx users in preparation for Luke being away for a few days. Kept developing through the afternoon with limited successes.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 21">Slow Monday. Lots of email to catch up on, and then a bit of the usual start-of-the-sprint malaise. Also spent a big chunk of time working on the Excel automation stuff, which I think I finally understand! Also helped Joe with a bit of Mac help.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 22">Finally wrapped up the Excel automation today which felt like a good milestone! I suspect it's something I could do in less than a quarter of the time on the second go. Checked on those suspect HDMI cables, and also did some reading about modern JS before ducking out early to try to catch some freshies in the Fingers.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 23">Meeting day plus the big Jami party! She's so rad, it's a bummer she won't be around the office any more... Anyhow, had a couple meetings, and started stubbing a bit of work on the new distribution list widget. Not very productive. So sleepy. Blah.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 24">Hammered out some serious front-end dev today - Almost completely finished the new distribution list widget. Very focused. That was about all for today!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 25">Super short day, just a quick visit before heading out to the Rockies this afternoon. Tested and fixed a couple little bugs in the widget from yesterday, caught up on a few emails, logged the last few days' work, and made a quick update to Audrey's Excel processes. Planning to sneak out at noon and perhaps weasel in a run.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 30">First day back in a long time. Super tired, and totally bogged down with meetings. Finished up a few bug fixes for the latest InfoEx release, and that's about it other than attending meetings and getting caught up!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 31">Still ticking things off the list - made the latest Excel updates, did a lot of work on user study planning for the upcoming site visits, and distributed/set up some monitors and other nice gadgets for folks.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 1st">Lots of little things to check off: reformatting Joe's old Macbook, tracking down some email bugs Emily found, reformatting Jami's old computer, distributing the latest Excel utilities, writing the rest of the user-study plan for the upcoming site visits, printing and supplying for the site visits also, and doing some support training. Plus afternoon beers with the gang!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 19">First day back in a long time! Synthesized a lot of the observations from the recent site visit tour and started hacking away at a few more InfoEx bugs from the current sprint - one was a one-liner. Working a bit with the email stuff... *shudder*</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 20">Another decently solid one. Fixed a bug that came up in theh distribution list widget, and resolved the easiest PDF email bug (woo!). Attended the weekly meeting and checked a lot of little, misc. tasks off the to-do (expense claims, some emails, etc.)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 21">Hacked away at some server side PDF stuff but some of the tricks I thought of didn't work... Managed to scrounge up a relevant tutorial about the problem that I'll try to walk through tomorrow. Also checked off a couple misc. tasks around future member offer stuff, and Stuart's new monitor. Headed out early in an attempt to climb ice for the 3rd day in a row.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 22">Long one! Developing away. Luke and Stuart are busy interviewing lots of people... I fielded a call from Scott Wickson that went reasonably well. Not much new, really...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 25">Not bad for a Monday - almost flew by honestly. Hacked away on the whole run-list status settings stuff and have gotten pretty close now but am stuck on the "not considered" setting that's somehow getting filtered before it even reaches my code... arg. Anyhow. Off to make some milkshakes!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 26">Came in late after ice climbing at Waterworld, woo! Solid afternoon. Met with Luke and reviewed Stuart's spec for the upcoming remote weather work, debugged the pdf settings, tracked down the problem with the "Not Considered" status, and chatted with Kylie from the store a bit near the end. Solid.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 27">Long, solid dev day. Got a lot done and tested some recently completed stuff. It's coming along well! Also set up for the weekly meeting. Oh! And we did some testing of the whole microwave-wifi-Luke problem. That's all.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 28">Did a bunch of developing and testing! Reviewed some of my recent work with Luke and made a plan to hand off most of it to him while I'm away. 'bout to be gone for a while...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="March 19">First day back in a long time! Lots to catch up on, hours being the biggest one... Spent a while catching up on emails this morning, paid membership dues, completed member-offer stuff, sorted some AGM logistics with Audrey, resolved some office IT stuff for Jess, reviewed some system issues that came up while I was away, practiced responding to some of those issues, Co-programmed a solution to INFOEX-911, and did a solid chunk of dev work on the blank run-list PDF re-implement, and avalanche obs printing.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 20">Solid dev day, just cranked away on the blank run-list stuff, and then smashed out some work on the printable shot-sheets. Took Stuart's monitor for an inspection (Luke reports it's not working), and attended the weekly meeting. Lots of code, woo!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 21">So sleepy today... Nevertheless, sorted out a couple more Jira tickets, switched out Stuart's monitor, and had some chats with Brent about AGM video stuff (brief).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 22">Another solid one. Wrapped up another Jira issue, this one with a bit of tricksy server stuff that went reasonably well. Also worked a little longer on Stuart's monitor, and planned out some upcoming work (to be ready as Luke leaves town tomorrow). Also, also worked with Jess a bit on Adobe stuff... That is all.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 23">Just logged in for a short two hours to work on planning the upcoming photo selection party and review some of the latest Dynatrace activity.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="March 25">Ugh... Got nearly zero sleep last night and just can't focus at all today. Anyhow, I worked on INFOEX-804 as much as possible, cleaned up some leftovers in last weeks code, caught up on an expense claim, met briefly with Brent about the photo selection party, and set up a time to install Adobe on Jess' machine. Heading out early since I just can't seem to get this development work done...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 26">Sort of a crescendo. Wrapped up a bug in the morning, then got caught up helping Luke with a release remotely in the afternoon (some problems came up in some code we wanted to push out, so quick fixes all around). Also installed the stuff with Jess!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 27">Not much going on today. Fixed a one-liner in the AM, reviewed the AGM schedule, rigged the weekly meeting, met w/ Luke n' Stuart, then started responding to new bugs as Stuart found them through the afternoon.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 28">Quiet day at the office, makes for lots of dev time! Hammered out a few more Jira issues in preparation for the upcoming release, and tackled some more as they came in. Some tricky ones, some one liners. Got a lot done!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 29">A quieter day again, what a treat! Hammered out some really small Jira tickets in the morning, worked a bit on VCS stuff and responding to a support email Stuart looped me in on, helped Jess with some cabling she's gathering for a course, assisted Audrey with some computer troubles, and got about 80% through reviewing Luke's new code. Solid!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="April 1">Pretty miscellaneous day. Knocked out 1 Jira issue, finished reviewing Luke's newest code, responded to a Dynatrace alert, assisted Jess with some misc. Excel issues that had been on the backburner for a while, and responded to all but 1 of the comments in the latest pull request!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 2">Half day - just the afternoon! Did some programming and updating for the upcoming new release, and tried to take care of the monthly Jira/Confluence backups. Slow day!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 3">Lots of meetings n' such. Wound up getting sucked into resolving some bugs for the new release through the afternoon. Lots of programming. Also got authorized to plan some more user-study work around the AGM, so that's cool! Not much time to start on it today, but soon.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 4">Caught up on a lot of misc. things today. Some dev work, confluence/Jira backups, installing some things, computer updates, and I'm sure some other things I just can't remember now (forgot to do this today so I'm writing this 5 days in the future).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 5">Super short day, just wound up getting really caught up in all the apartment hunting stuff with Jess. Had a short meeting with Luke about upcoming work and what I'll keep busy with while he's away next week which went well. Also did a little bit of dev work!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="April 8">Solid and almost long day! Kept chopping away at the upcomign HCI plan, tackled two tiny Jira issues, reviewed some API docs Luke wrote, helped Kat with some computer troubles, and got caught up on some of the Dynatrace alerts from the weekend.</p> 
            <p class="entry" date="April 9">Another day of lots of little things. Made some little diagrams and added some notes to Luke's API doc, chopped a little farther into the AGM HCI plan, and tackled about 1.75 more bugs logged in Jira. Not too bad, but some of the bugs are proving to be quite tricky...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 10">A medium day. Knocked out 1.5 more Jira tickets which is good (consulted with Luke on 1 and realized I was making a silly error, should have just looked at it with fresh eyes in the morning!). Set up the weekly meeting, and afterwards chatted with Stuart to calibrate development priority, and in the afternoon worked on the HCI plan for the AGM, also helped Jess resolve some email-related YM issues with some CNAME and TXT records (awaiting confirmation that that worked). Oh, and I installed Adobe w/ Kristin!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 11">Started out crushing pretty hard in the morning on some dev work - making a new pop-up-style dialogue for new versions of InfoEx. Wrapped that up around 1:30, had a meeting with Luke about workflow development around 2, de-bugged some sneaky YM pages for Andrea around 3, and that's about it! Felt like some dead-time in between things. Starting to run out of work again... Hm.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 12">Super quiet day at the office, almost no-one here! Knocked out one small Jira issue, worked a bit more on HCI planning, finished my online cybersecurity training, helped Andrea with some YM stuff, reviewed and resolved that YM/AWS stuff from yesterday, and chatted a bit w/ Kristin about staff photo contest selection stuff.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 13">Just put in an hour and a half on prepping for the CAA photo contest selecition party :) It's a goer! There's enough submissions now!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 14">Knocked out a couple of small Jira tickets around the photo overlay viewer at Dose.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 15">So frickin' tired... Damnit Harold! Reviewed some upcoming work w/ Luke and got some dev time in. Sort of started de-bugging that awful problem with the run list locations showing up in a barely, barely different order in the pdfs and client. Soooo boring. Issue 910 also just got a lot more complicated, and I got about half way through re-doing that, which is going fine so far!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 16">sssooooo ssslllloooowwww.... Just some extremely tedious de-bugger work to find out why the location lists in PDFs are different from the ones in the workflow summary view. Anyhow. Found the cause. Haven't thought of what to do about it yet... But I will! Also got in late because dentist.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 17">Way more exciting than yesterday, but that's a low bar, of course. Got a bit of dev work done in the morning, spent a fair bit of time digging into a Dynatrace alert that was a little weirder than the usual. Weekly meeting (exciting, Patagucci bags!), and a longer IT meeting around AGM User Study stuff. Got a lot done on the user study plan, which was great! Also did a bit of work on the new update handling code. Going to start testing that tomorrow!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 18">Slow day... Almost no one in the office. Got some shoddy dev work done, mostly just tedious debugger work on the run-list stuff, followed by tedious sort algorithm work to resolve it, finaly followed by the most inconvenient di-bugging ever with the app cache manifest file that has to be pipelined to productione TWICE any time I want to test some new code FML... Anyhow, that's all mostly done, so hopefully it'll be smoother sailing in the coming days!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 19">PARAMJIT'S WAS CLOSED >:( NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO</p>   
            
            <p class="entry" date="April 22">Pretty normal day, mostly just developing on INFOEX-910 (the lil' pop-ups to reload for a new version). Also met with Luke briefly about map interface ideas for the potential new mobile app which was interesting... Meh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 23">Just a tense day... I don't know why. Stuart and Luke seem really high strung. I assume there's still a bunch of stuff going on with new hires that they won't tell me about, which is frustrating. Anyhow, hid in the meeting room for a while working on paper prototypes, put some final touches on INFOEX-910, set up some things for new staff (Alex), and gathered some supplied for the photo contest selection party tomorrow. Woo!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 24">So social! Weekly meeting, plus a longer InfoEx meeting to run through a couple of the prototypes for the upcoming user study- then a bit of working through minor dev responses to Luke's comments on the latest pull request. Hammered out most of the survey questions (woo!), and then the AGM photo contest selection party went off without a hitch! Yay!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 25">Kind of a long dry one... Wrote some survey questions, chopped even more on this darn 910 issue, continued to slog through this new Lake Louise issue (that's shockingly convoluted...), and did a bit of admin/reimbursement stuff I'd been putting off for a long time.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 26">Kind of a slow one.... Did some detailed and thorough de-bugging on the Lake Louise issue, which is now solved! Also tested the last issue with INFOEX-910, which works now, so that's all wrapped up. Tried to help get Alex all set up with his new software which sort of worked :/ Windows is confusing...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="April 29">Kind of an intense one, just a ton going on! Iterated again on the survey questions which went reasonably well but required some follow-up re-writes. Chopped a little on a Jira ticket about sorting PWL's, but reviewed with Stuart and it looks like there's more to do there than I originally anticipated.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 30">Wrote out a few more of the edits from yesterday's survey meeting, and then iterated on it one more time today. Finished up the final bits of the paper prototypes (those darn tedius obs pop-ups), and then practiced a bit with them. Also sent a number of emails about upcoming things and sorted some time off for a WFR with Luke. Also copied the AGM schedule into my personal calendar to review that! Oh, and also, also followed up on a lead from Eiri about a potential bug in Slack.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 1">Another really busy one - didn't even get to eat lunch until almost 2! Made more edits to the user study plan, discussed further with Luke and Stuart. Attended the weekly meeting, and ran Stuart thorugh a pilot afterwards - came back with a lot of concerns to incorporate. Spent the afternoon adjusting the study structure, and moving the online survey questions into a YM survey.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 2">Another hot and fast one! Ran a pilot wit Jess in the AM and came back with a few more updates. Adjusted the study script to include feedback from Stuart that came in overnight as well. Ran another pilot with Stuart, and gathered a few last, small changes that needed attention. Also put the final touches on the YM survey, and made the last edits to the fillable sheet we'll use for in-person interviews, but MS Office started failing for almost 2 hours once I was ready to preint it. I worked on 2 Jira tickets, reviewed about half of Stu's latest automated Wx doc, and that's that!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 3">Bombshell of a day... ... dayum. Not sure what to make of this one. Anyhow. Ticked off 1 more Jira issue, revised and formatted interview sheets, made some final edits to the online survey, discussed some final study logistics with Luke and Stuart, and fielded 3 tech support call for Scott at Sunshine about retrieving and printing shot-sheets. Took off early to keep packing!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 21">First day back in a loooong time! AGM went well. This morning, spent some time tracking down obs to be deleted, as well as my ssh keys I think I accidentally deleted last week (oops). Worked a couple more hours on survey analysis, and also had a long planning meeting with Stuart and Luke this afternoon (skill gaps when Luke departs, and mobile tech).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 22">Action packed! Started working on the survey report (which I finished today) when I got in but was snagged almost immediately for a meeting out the new remote weather integration for 45 minutes with Steve and Brad (plus Luke and Stu). After that, got a call from Kathy with some tasks, one of which is easy and the other which is postponed pending managerial approval. Conducted tech for the weekly staff meeting. Had a long IT/InfoEx meeting, lots to chat about including the mobile survey results. Spent a good chunk of the afternoon chopping away at solving the SSH access issue, and then wrapping up the survey report!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 23">Meh.... Got super wired in the AM and hammered out almost all of the report on the user study. That was good. Met briefly w/ Brent about Avaya stuff and did some follow-up afterwards (couldn't download via Avaya, but the third party file didn't show any viruses when scanned...). Contacted Kenny (so overdue, yikes...), and had a real small check-in w/ Stuart about the recent survey results (note to self, never admit errors).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 24">A fairly quiet Friday. Worked a touch more on the user study report, but not a ton. Stuart sent over some things to add, which I'll need ot incorporate soon. Worked a bit on setting up the mac for Kristin, and then worked a bit on getting her O365 accounts running again. Met with Stuart about Andrew. Spent most of the afternoon moving the office around (hooray...), and then just a tad at the end of the day looking into what it might look like to run our dev server with VS Code instead of Eclipse... Hm...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 27">Just feeling slow, tired, and dumb today... Anyhow. Tackled one little Jira issue, met with Stuart a bit about how to meet, worked on updating the mobile survey report, and worked on resolving my unfortunate IAM issues :o </p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 28">A little less slow and tired than yeterday, but not by much... Nevertheless! Finally finished the AGM reports (woo!). Also tackled 1.5 Jira tickets, and fixed all the IAM issues thanks to Luke. So not too bad overall...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 29">Slow and clunky. Just not making much headway on the Japan map bug, or the Wiki migration. The Mapbox docs are pretty dense and I don't think I'm editing in the right place, and I just can't frickin' get the SSH on the Wiki server to work (WTFFF???). Super flustered... Trying to decompress a bit before going home.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 30">Breakthrough! Finally made some more serious progress on the Wiki migration... Got the access running and the database copied. That is all :) Still chopping away!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 31">Not a bad Friday, I ate Pam's at least! Got Brent's old computer wiped, but not re-installed yet. Spun up a new MediaWiki instance on AWS, but it isn't quite working yet :/ lools like Apache errors... Anyhow, off for the weekend!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 3">Sort of a busy one, kind of... Scheduled a check-up for Emily's computer when she's away later this month, looked into a Chrome bug Eiri uncovered, finally finished with reformatting Brent's old desktop, helped get some report definitions to Stuart, did a final pass on the user study reports, consulted with Jess about a spam-y email she recieved, looked into some software that had expored on Emily's computer, and made a bit of progress on migrating the Wiki! Action packed.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 4">Solid day! Finally got some real progress on the Wiki Migration - the database is now ported over, the site is accessible via the public IPs, and the images are mostly there (although the thumbnails are broken). Worked on that almost exclusively today, although I did have some quick other bits helping Brent move some things to the basement, helping Jess debug some HTML, and reviewing a document for Stuart.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 5">Typical Wednesday, not much dev work... Spent a little while this morning scratching around in an effort to solve some Outlook Calendar problems for Alex, but no dice. Weekly meeting, then InfoEx/IT meeting. Then trying to resolve some OneDrive issues for Kristen which did work out! Then a Skype meeting with my mentor Kenny. Finally, hashing out (what I hope to be) the last bug on the new InfoEx Wiki! Sent that off to Stuart, and I'm headed home for the evening.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 6">Got a fair bit done on the Japan Map Bug today, mostly on the client side. Did a lot of digging into options for resolving the database, but not much luck yet.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 7">Made a lot more progress on the Japan Map Bug today! Found some key PostGIS software-y bits that will make this possible, including a function for selecting db entries within a specific rectagle, and another function for adjusting longitudes in exactly our situation. Now just to wire it all up... Couldn't quite crack it before quittin' time :/
            </p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 11">Luke's back!!! Yay!!! I'm also very, very tired from climbing yesterday. Most of the morning went into reviewing the last two weeks with Luke which went pretty well. The afternoon was mostly spent on the Wiki migration (installing the darn annoying extensions). That's about it!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 12">Action packed! Arrived just in time for the weekly meeting. After that Luke and I upgraded the InfoEx Canada server to a larger instance. Then I ran through the monthly server upgrading/patching which went really smoothly. Next I started running our semi-annual attachments temp folder cleaning which was suuuuuper slow... In the meantime, I finished installing the Wiki extensions, and filled out the somewhat lengthy Spring Conference feedback form. That is all!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 13">Odd one... Luke and I worked on redistributing Jill's old O365 stuff to the staff who it now makes sense for that stuff to go to. Met with Luke, Stuart, and Kristin from like 9:30 to 12:30 about transition stuff.... Which felt really hard and a bit frustrating at time. I'm not sure I like what my job is becoming. Overheard a conversation around lunch where Luke was demoted and may no longer attend managers' meetings... yikes. Ran the patches on the important InfoEx instances, and then finished the day by fixing the last problem with the new wiki, and writing a doc about how to run the migration in the future!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 17">Such a quiet day in the office, that was nice! I wrapped up a few more Jira tickets, most of which were pretty much finished but just needed some testing. Also struggled a long while with some database issues that were popping up, seemed like it was caused by switching to and from the hazard assesment branch. Arg, much frustrate. Also it was waaaaay too hot in the office today. Booo.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 18">Suuuuuuuper boring, just some really dry sys admin work almost all day. I guess in the morning I spent an hour getting some vector graphic editor software running to work on pattern fill for shot sheet editor stuff. Anyhow, the rest of it was just AWS things, mostly trying to find a yum repo for automatically keeping Tomcat up to date (which I'm starting to think is impossible). Oh, also some misc. IT stuff came up, like some Excel issues for Jess and some HTML issues with Audrey.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 19">Wednesdays... Worked on some more sysadmin-y stuff with Luke in the morning which involved a lot of miscommunications and redundant work, but we got there! Next, meeting time... Tricky IT meeting, just hard to communicate together. I don't feel like Luke, Stuart, and I are always on the same page... Anyhow, afternoon, worked on upgrading Tomcat on QA and got it queued up to execute tomorrow morning, updated my Patagonia Pro application, did a bit more HTML email work for Audrey, and talked to Audrey about AvSAR reg. yay!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 20">Super quick day, just 3 hours in the office. Mostly worked on executing the Tomcat 9 upgrade on QA which I appear to have finished juuuust in time (would have been faster if I hadn't messed up the irreversable VPC settings on my first try... Oops). Had a quick meeting w/ Luke and Stuart to review some of the new hazard-related features, and Luke brought me some cake! Woo!
            </p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 21">Kind of a long one... Started the day with a somewhat long meeting planning upcoming work with Luke and Stuart. After that, a quick check-in w/ Luke planning some code sharing for a bit of dev work I aspire to do this weekend on the Japan Map bug. Spent a few hours on the Tomcat 9.0.21 upgrade on QA which unfortunately I had to do <i>again</i> because another microscopic yet crucial setting was misaligned (frickin' AWS...). Then I wrapped up the day by working on the Japan Map bug for an hour or so!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 22">Weekend work day. Caught up on some admin stuff first like cleaning up my file directory, updating my hours tracking spreadsheet, and reviewing some Wiki docs that were on my to-do list. Worked on the Japan Map Bug for a little while after that but really just kinda sucked and couldn't focus real good today :/ arg. </p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 23">Worked 2 hours on Emily's CAARAT stuff from home.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 24">Farts... Worked pretty much all day on this gosh darn Japan Map bug that is <i>waaaay</i> harder to make happen at runtime. The tools for modifying a geometry SUCK! Ugh... Couldn't finish it. Going home. Barf...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 25">Ugh Fart... Just so stuck with this JTE Geometry library stuff...  Also had a terrible run at lunch today and came back hobbling. Anyhow, caught up on email right at the end of the day just so I could feel like I did something. Had a meeting with Kristin near the end about transition stuff and also consulted with Emily a bit about IT things. Worked 1 extra hour after to transfer notes about L1 exam for Emily (separate project cost)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 26">A little more progress than yesterday. Worked briefly with Luke on some sys admin in the morning (dealing with an expired SSL cert for the "backup" website Joe was stoked on). Got a solid start on the annual InfoEx backup which is pretty slow on account of all the image attachments. Weekly meeting. Addressed the fork problem. Made some solid headway on pattern fills for avalanches in the shot sheet editor, but may have found a fatal gap in the underlying library :( That's about it, really...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 27">Just dev in the morning, and the loooooong, long Duck Labs meeting in the afternoon... That's about it! Finally cracked the case on the pattern fill issue, that was good. Wrapped up early for beerz in the loading bay with the gang.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 28">Friday at last! Hammered out some really, really solid dev work on the shot sheet editor for about half the day, which felt nice. Spent a big chunk of the afternoon slogging through the InfoEx backups which wound up being trickier than I'd expected, and remains at large... Oh! Also had a meeting in the AM with a rep from AWS which went well.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 2">First day back after moving. Forgot to write this one before leaving for vacation, so I can't really remember what happened here... Looks like a long day of IT and sysadmin work. I think I trialed some of the monthly patches... Can't remember much else :/</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 3">Very long, frustrating day... Left in the middle for a haircut. Knocked out 1 more Tomcat upgrade before the weekly meeting, but largely struggled with them in the afternoon. Found some problems with the versioning in some of the releases I did that needed fixing, and then the last InfoEx release I was trying to do at the end of the day just kept failing over and over endlessly. Super frustrating.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 5">Last day before leaving for a while! Finally wrapped up the last couple </p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 16">First day back in a long time! Luke and I worked through most of the annual AWS checkup, which left a few possible action items to run by Stuart. Some of them also involved some follow-up research that took a little while. OMG... So tired... wow.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 17">Very miscellaneous. Morning, catching up on shelved work like the Japan Map Bug and API documentation, afternoon doing some IT support, sys admin, and general raging at computers en route to development, plus some meetings in the middle (full staff, plus AWS checkup review with Stuart). Trying to get out by 4 for some running with Jess!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 18">Late start after a small running debacle in the rain. Worked a bit on AWS IAM settings in the morning promted by Brad, switched over to API documentation for a while, ultimately switched back to dev in the late afternoon (small bit of Japan map bug, and some work on the smaller outstanding Jira tickets that came out of the AGM).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 19">Helped Joe and Emily with some IT concerns in the morning, worked a bit on dev (the SZ improvements for Av Obs), met with L+S about some of the updates with Brad, connected with Luke about our meeting next week, continued the dev in the afternoon, picked up Emily's computer, and wrapped up the day researching possible solutions for Emily's computer issues.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 22">Worked from home today on account of the roofing issues. Consulted on some emails with Brad, brushed up on my Node knowledge in preparation for new developments also with Brad, responded to emails, researched some AWS options following up on those emails, and got a little bit of dev done on the Japan Map Bug.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 23">Super tired after climbing early this morning... Got a little done on the Japan Map Bug, although that's not getting much better. Had some longer chats with Luke and Stu about possible Brad developments and the outsourced situation, worked a little longer on Emily's laptop which I have some ideas about, and finally purchased a new one of those broken mini USB's!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 24">Arrived crazy late after a long breakfast discussion with Jess, weekly meeting, planning meeting w/ Luke and Stu, some team-dev with Luke, started looking over some new work, and then left early after getting caught in endless traffic trying to quickly pick up our CSA for the week... Arg.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="July 30">Geeze... What happened today... Caught up on 1,000 emails from Microsoft, read some articles on VCS Luke sent, waded through VCS Hell thanks to frickin' Eclipse again, and fielded a phone call from a confused website user (passed him along to Andrea).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="July 31">Meh... Long meeting with Duck again. I leave each meeting with even less faith about the project... But whatevs. Checked in with Emily and Kristin separately about misc IT work that's been ongoing, and also met with Luke about some of the more interesting recent Hibernate work he's been doing. Got a bit of dev done... meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 1">Slow day... Worked a bit on some Jira tickets, but just felt a little slow and dumb. Fielded a couple phone calls that should have gone to Av Can. Is that really all that happened today? Oh! Tried to work some more on Kristen's Mac but the password she provided didn't work. Oh! And I finally helped Jess with that Excel automation that we've postponed like 10,000 times, so that's cool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 2">IT Day. Fielded some emails about Bit Bucket issues, ran the monthly Jira/Confluence backups, met with Stuart, Brad, and Jess about automated wx work, and mostly finished the annual IT inventory. yay...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 6">Meh... Did a bit of dev. Celebrated Audrey's birthday. Left a little early :/ Didn't get much done... Spent a good chunk of the morning in VCS hell. *sigh*</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 7">Meetings day. Attended weekly meeting, reviewed recent work including the IT inventory. Did some dev work in the afternoon but got interrupted by a few more calls about ITP stuff... meh.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 9">Got a little wired and pounded out some code on the distribution list stuff. Arrived late and left a little early. Very tired today.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 10">Very, very short day. Wrote a few lines of code, reviewed some of Lukes new code, and then got distracted and spent much of the day on personal work. Not many CAA hours.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 12">Just so slow today. Brain don werk so gud. Made one good breakthrough, though, on how to make my distribution list code more reusable. That's good, I guess...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 13">Holy wow... So bored... Haven't spoken to a human in the office in days and it's getting a little weird. Helped un-jam a printer for Jess this morning. Otherwise just chopping away sloooowly on dev work. The distribution list stuff is coming together. Meh... Sorta.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 14"></p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 19">Worked from home since I didn't have a car today - mostly reviewed Luke's pull requests, as well as Brad's new code. Worked a little on distribution list development. Started early and ended early.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 20">Met with Stuart again for the first time in a long time! Hit a roadblock on distribution list development :/ arg. Fiddled with VCS for ages to resurrect the ancient Sponsorhip branch. Get some last-minute work from Emily fixing a microphone and an ancient computer... Shmeh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 21">Meetings day... Spent most of the morning fixing computers and backing up InfoEx attachments to the video capture laptop. Afternoon was mix of development and popping off site here and there for meetings/CSA. Made some progress on sponsorship, but started getting weird errors right at the end of the day.... Ugh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 22">Luke is back, yay! Mostly wrapped up the UI side of the sponsorship stuff, but got some beta from Luke on the build-time scripting stuff that means more work to do. Also, conferred with Luke and resolved some questions I had around the multiple distribution list stuff, which leaves even more work to do, but at least it makes sense now.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 23">Slow day... Worked a little on the build scripts for the sponsorship work, and I think it's done but I'm not sure how to test it (plus I've still got to find some way to implement the same thing with environment on the server...). Luke and I got together and smashed out some big merges too, so that was good!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 24">Short but productive Saturday session! Made some serious progress on the multiple-distribution-list stuff at long last! Cracked the case. Yay.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="August 26">Highly productive and caffeinated morning with a rapid deterioration around 2:30... Anyhow. Smashed out the last of the multiple distribution list work (put it to bed, finally), and met with Stuart about the new aspect/elevation rose work. Cranked out a huge re-write of some seriously crappy code (we've <bold>GOT</bold> to start using JSX!!!) to make room for the new changes. That is all!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 27">READY TO THROW THIS COMPUTER OUT THE WINDOW!!! WFT IS WRONG WITH THIS DAMN ASPECT/ELEVATION ROSE WIDGET??? Worked on that damn thing all damn day...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 28">Busy meetings day. Switched over to the server side of that aspect/elevation stuff and made a lot of progress at various times throughout the day, also resolved issue 204 I think. Got a keyboard for Alex, ran some errands, chatted with people who were waiting in the breakroom, that sort of thing...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 29">Wrapped up the server side of the aspect/elevation stuff... Meh. Addressed an issue with Kat's keyboard (the delete key fell off... Sounds like a hard week for Kat). Also spent some time looking into a shady email that Audrey received, ostensibly from Jess' account although hard to say really. Seems like it may have been generated on account of a YM bug? Also Stuart added another bug to my sprint. Oh! And I consulted with Stuart about deplying some of Jess/Brad's code although then they never followed up and nothing came of it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="August 30">Started right out of the gate with a Duck meeting... They demoed. Subsequently went balls deep with the Chrome debugger and finally, finally, finally got the stupid aspect/elevation rose to run. It's not even close to done, but at least the current problem is resolved... Okonomiyaki special for lunch was nice. So there's a win!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 2">Just a short one on a holiday! Caught up on Jira/Confluence backups, followed up on some spam mail sent ostensibly from Joe, caught up on emails n things, read Stuart's feedback to Duck (quite long), and kind of sort of did some development work... Not that much, though :/ Also spent some time ealing with the freezer disaster!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 3">Got called in early this morning because the internet was down... Spent basically the entire day trying to figure out what the hell was wrong... Anyhow, got it solved eventually! Worked a little on the distribution list stuff at the tail end, but was pretty tired and slow by that point...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 4">Wednesdays, Wednesdays... Cupcakes, though, yay! Meetings, early setup with Joe, reviewed spear phishing in meeting, worked on InfoEx Help Wiki issues, tried to fix Kat's keyboard (no luck), pre-patch trials, reset a password, and got in a couple hours of dev (not super productive).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 5">Pretty solid dev day, got a lot done on the rose stuff, but there's still more to do (duh)... Also helped Audrey out with an Excel Macro issue, fielded a number of calls about the online level 1, consulted with Kat about the online level 1 issues, and helped Jess fix the printer downstairs.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 6">That meeting at AvCan demo-ing aVid.... Wow. Also helped Kat with a printer issue, and Audrey with some Excel troubles. Poop.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 9">Welp... back at the grind. Made a tiny bit of progress on including PWL asp/elev data in reports, but quickly got derailed with stupidly confusing errors... Got some help from Luke on sponsorship work, yay! Duck meeting... Blah...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 10">Arrived late and was gone for a big chunk in the middle of the day... Almost pure development. Morning, resolved the sponsorship work (yay), afternoon kept working on aspect/elevation rose stuff. Found one bug, but there's still problems... The infinite gift. Just keeps giving and giving and giving...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 11">Started out doing some dev work on the aspect elevation rose stuff (turns out it was working yesterday, I just couldn't find the column that confirmed it!). Meetings, meetings, meetings... Worked through some map stuff in the back seat with Luke driving. Then the ruxitagent bug came up... Scrambled around with the others on that one into the evening... Ugh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 12">Back on the ruxitagent work... Did that almost all day until changing over to reviewing various documents - NIF application, lifecycle analysis, and eventually the disaster recovery doc. Blah...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 13">Not super productive... Spent just about the entire morning in meetings, mostly about the new mobile app visual design stuff. Got a little bit of dev work done in the afternoon, but I was a little too tired for some of the super tedius de-bugger work... Also Audrey had a lot of Excel questions... Hmph.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Overnight Sep. 13-14">Worked from 9:30 to 2:30 trying to fix a bug Stuart found where attachments weren't opening. I ultimately put out a little hot-fix release with a small line of code changed to resolve the issue. What a crappy weekend.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 14">After last night's adventures, something was wrong with QA... I spent all day trying to figure out how to fix it. It came from somewhere deep in Hibernate during authentication - an array out of bounds exception... Not really sure I understood what was wrong or how it was resolved, but eventually after enough restarts, db restorations, and client/server released; it just stopped happening... Ugh.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 16">Busiest Monday in a while... Spent most of the morning gathering records of the weekend's goings-on to report to Luke and Stuart, attended a meeting across town just before lunch, met with Luke about the weekend stuff around lunch, then met with the Duck dev team, then reported to Stuart about the weekend, then spent my last few hours gathering docs and other misc tasks for Duck. No development at all...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 17">Full speed straight out of the gate... Caught two calls about an AvSAR course and flailed trying to find someone to transfer them to, spent some time figuring out what our "Stand Up" meeting with Duck was, fiddled with Dynatrace a while before getting admin permissions from Luke, re-enabled RUM (follow up on last Wednesday), added Brad to Dynatrace so he can view logs, re-deployed the client to all envirnments, helped Emily to to remove an AC, helped Kristin fix some printer issues, wrote a Confluence doc on Hotfixes, met with Luke about mobile report viewing, and spent a tiny amount of time debugging asp/elev rose code... Ugh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 18">Walked into the office and the phone was ringing again... How is everything so crazy hectic right now??? Anyhow. Met with Duck in the morning, Luke after that, and then had a slightly extra long weekly meeting. Finally tied a bow on some longstanding dev issues after that, though. Went home early. So frickin' tired... Ugh.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="September 29">Just a quick hour of catching up on email and Slack in hopes of returning Monday sort of caught up and knowing what's going on...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="September 30">Weeeeeelp... Back to the grind. Lots of bug-fixes to tackle in the last round of development. Just kinda slamming through those. One Dynatrace error popped up - hard to figure out, but turned out to be a Swede trying to figure out the API on Svenska. Found an issue with logging that's related, but Stuart asked that I not follow up and prioritize development instead.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 1">Mostly dev work... Lots of little things, but a big chunk was just continuing to hammer away at the stupid elevation rose stuff... Also some meetings and confusion surrounding who's looking into the Dynatrace error from yesterday, and what to do about release scheduling. Also just found out Stuart's going to be gone for a month... Who knew.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 2">Busy, busy, busy. Some solid dev in the morning (got some critical bits done). Refreshed the QA database, deployed some new Brad/Jess code, ran quarterly log rotation, trialed tomorrow's patches, rand monthly Jira/Confluence backups, had a staff meeting, IT meeting is delayed, had a meeting with Duck, consulted with Audrey, and enjoyed Kristin's leadership training (although it gives me existential dread about my work here).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 3">A pretty normal day, I think? (Trying to write this from memory the day after, oops). Lots of dev work, did the quarterly log rotation... I think that's it... Oh! And a late-night Dynatrace response.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 4">Pretty much just meetings, it seems like... Disaster recovery, then Hookano, then reviewing the new mobile code while waiting for Luke for lunch, then IT meeting, then a run with a bunch of the office, a tiny bit of development, some chats with Stuart about the hiring process, and eventually upgrading some BitBucket processes.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 5">Quick lil' Saturday catch up. Made some real minor tweaks to the Mammut logo stuff and did some site visit planning.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 7">New week new Ben! Not really... Released to QA a couple times for various reasons, stayed online while Stuart made some decisions about development work, and ultimately the only real productive thing I did was to make some headway on API documentation. Blegh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 8">Ugh so dry n' boring holy poos... Got my environment all set up to start some coding on the mobile project, but very promptly was redirected to start researching breaking changes for CMH which ate up pretty much all but 45 minutes of the day. So boring. Oh wow. Also got called down urgently to Emily's office about a YM issue but restarting the browser seemed to fix the issue. That is all.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 9">Fun to see Luke in the morning! Mostly meetings today; IT, staff, and Duck. Got a little bit of misc. dev tasks snuck in between all the other stuffs, but not a lot really.... That's all.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 10">Least bad day in a while! Got to chop away a bit on the tool-tips in the new React App (so much more fun to develop in than the ye olde system). Met Dru, seems nice enough. Got a fair bit done, yay!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="October 14">Responded to a Dynatrace alert, but when I went to post about it in Slack Stuart did the same thing. Totally unnecessary... Arg. Also tried to catch up on Slack chatter, but couldn't really make much sense of it...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 15">Feels like I was away for weeks... So much to catch up on. Scrambled in last second for a meeting that I was only sent an invite to 20 minutes before it started, spent almost 2 hours trying to make sense of the Slack chatter from the past weekend, started a tiny bit of planned dev work, but was quickly re-assigned to bug fixes in the mobile app, had a heart-to-heart with Joe, and submitted a pull request near the end of the day... that's about it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 16">Pretty typical Wednesday. Meetings, meetings, meetings. Met with Luke for a sort of exit interview kind of thing. Weekly Duck meeting - only just realized the emperor is nude, Luke also has no idea what they're talking about during sprint planning... Also faffed with some code that was working, but Duck mis-communicated about so they were reviewing the wrong code. Worked on improving server errors for no user agreement stuff... Long day.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 17">Caught up on a bunch of CAA development today - mostly the Jira backlog. That's all I can specifically remember (currently writing this 5 days late).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 18">Worked from home, very nice to bike a bit less. Just smashed out some development on the mobile project mostly. Added some responsive text and a new modal.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 19">Worked some weekend hours setting up the new computer for Meg.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 20">Continued working through some lingering Meg setup issues with Stuart - just some email/admin-centre back-n-forth</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 21">UGH... Left my computer at home. Wasted a ton of time getting enough updates installed on the video capture laptop to use it for work for the day. ONce it was set up I was able to tick off a few misc issues like QA releases, and finally smashed out the rest of the API documentation which I think is pretty much done now yay.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 22">Pretty wet, cold Tuesday... Worked a bit on mobile, but this new spec is just so over the top. Tidied a bit on the API docs. Power went out in the PM, so left a bit early. Fun.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 23">Wednesday... Meetings, some dev work on this ever-expanding mobile project. Our weekly Duck meeting was shitty... We're paying them to project-manage us? And poorly? WTF... Gorgeous day, though, got out for a very nice run.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 24">Ugh. How is this mobile codebase already so fucked up??? Trying to add a simple 'share now' prompt is like brain surgery. Had a work planning/estimation meeting with the Duck people, although I really don't know why... They're not working on this anymore, what do they care?? Hate this project.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 25">Fuck this fucking code... Spent a few more hours on this stupid 'share now' issue and found a hacky fix that wreaks of future sysadmin calls. Also consulted a bit with Stuart about a real fart of an un-reproducible bug in the ye olde client. Spent a couple hours in merge hell waiting for irreconcilable code to be checked in so I can resolve it. God damnit... I need a different job.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 26">Finally resolved the merge hell and finished the "Share Now" work. Glad that's over... Reviewed Luke's latest pull request also. It's so hard not to just refactor the whole Enter Observation file.... AAAAHHHH!!!!!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 27">Ugh... Woke up to Dynatrace alerts (my favourite way to wake up, don't you know), and capped off the evening responding to Slack messages from Stuart. Two half hour chunkos.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 28">Split day. Morning was busy (IT meetings, preparing speech for Luke's going away, greeting new person Meg, caught up on GoByBike, sent Stuart API docs, followed up on cybersecurity w/ Joe, scheduling emails w/ Stuart, pricing HDMI cords, etc. ), mid-day meeting w/ ski patrol, and afternoon mobile development.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 29">SUUUUPER cold fingers, ugh... Worked a bit on the broken OGRS link that had resolved of it's own accord by the time I got to it, caught up on some emails, set up cybersecurity training for a couple people, investigated our upstairs wifi which wasn't working, had a really inconclusive meeting with Duck people that felt wildly off topic in which nothing was decided, then Luke's going away! Mew! :'(</p>
            <p class="entry" date="October 30">Such a Wednesday. Up at 130am for Dynatrace, worked w/ Dynatrace support to filter these stupid Sweden alerts (didn't work), Worked on emails to Joe and Stu in the morning, weekly meeting, lunch w/ Joe (about Stu), Duck meeting (wtf?), some IT work on Andrea's new computer, investigating the stupid gateway timeout bug for a while, some O365 management for Meg's new email accounts, and a meeting w/ Luke about his React code review w/ Karl.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 4">Finally back after a couple sick days and the weekend. Jess is home! Finally smashed out the stupid sponsorship header stuff. That had been lingering for way too long, and I'm glad it's done.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 5">This all seems so chaotic now. Had a long meeting about how we're going to get this release out (woo). Spent most of the afternoon working through this weird attachments issue with Luke, and the results were interesting (s3fs stuff). Finally fixed some BitBucket issues we were having, and addressed some UI tweaks on mobile.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 6">Wednesdays... Morning Mac crisis (new updates uninstalled Brew. Fuck off, Mac). Weekly meetings, some sysadmin work getting the branches all cleaned up for testing, some more sysadmin looking into Git migration, monthly pre-patches, more ridiculous Duck meetings, and eventual darkness as another beautiful day slips quietly away.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 7">Responded to some Jira tickets that came back after testing, also investigated some other bugs, deployed some recent changes to QA, and... I can't remember the rest :/ forgot to log it, and I'm coming back to it 5 days later. Oops.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 8">Same as yesterday, forgot to log so writing this 5 days late. Spent at least 3 hours in annual review with Stuart (lots to cover there). Worked through a couple Jira tickets at least. MMmm... Can't remember everything. Farts.</p>
            
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 12">Dru's first day. Also it seems like everything is breaking (Dynatrace errors at 3 AM about monitoring being down, and more in the afternoon that remain unsolved - something to do with avalanche observation submission at Sunshine? Ugh). Spent a lot of time assisting Dru and trying to remember how I set up our stupid local dev environment in the first place. Also circled back in another shorter meeting with Stuart.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 13">Lots of working with Dru on the dev environment. Also weekly meeting, and a long meeting with Duck about working relationship going forward (meh... Somewhat productive). Also still working through various Dynatrace errors, and wrapping up more Jira tickets. Fuck there's so much going on all at once. I can hardly keep track of it all. Poo.</p> 
            <p class="entry" date="November 14">Mostly wrapping up little bugs here and there, and doing the sysadmin required to get a versioned release ready in preparation for the upcoming release. Also much helping Dru with stupid Eclipse. Left for a chunk in the middle of the day. Beers n gears. woo.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 15">F f f f f friday... Arrived pretty late. Long morning meeting. Dru's mostly set up now, which is pretty rad. Today was almost exclusively sysadmin with infrequent lil' code changes.</p>
            
            
            <p class='entry' date="November 18">Release explosion... What a mess.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 19">Long day. Morning, doing some testing around the release and a bit more training w/ Dru. Afternoon meeting with Sheldon (actually very fun/exciting), then late-day releases to Sweden and International (went well), and end of the day moving lots of stuff to the new office. Phew. So tired.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 20">Meeeeeetings. Oof. Also did a thrift run w/ Dru. Tested out a new incident logging system and had some crazy long meetings with the IT team about lots of stuff. Fixed the s3fs issue, I think? Also lots of talk about the release tomorrow. Moved the rest of the office stuff... I think that's all?</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 21">Release take 2! Went mo' better this time, although most of the day was responding to related stuff coming up. More might happen tonight... Made a post office run. Ugh so fucking tired I can't remember anything else. That's probably it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 22">CPD DAY! Long one... Video Capture went so-so. Oh well. Social afterwards was nice!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="November 25">Long meeting first thing about pager duty and how we're going to handle that. Released WX code to QA so the crew can get back to developing that, then some contacts about improving our alerting systems, Kat's going away party, then some Prettier work, Git migration work with Dru, an hour on the phone with O365 about Interac emails, and finally some work on iPhone icons.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 26">Started out fine, anyhow... Worked with Dru on some of the monthly sysadmin he'll do next week, then did some pair-programming on the mobile stuff, wrote a few emails, started working on our IRP, and then we had a crash and spent the rest of the day troubleshooting... Ugh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 27">Spent pretty much the whole day still troubleshooting yesterday's crash, not much fun going on. Met with Duck and staff, though. Eventually we got Brad on a call which was reassuring about all of it. Long frickin' day - 7 to 6 with only a couple short breaks.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 28">Worked from home, so nice... Mobile work in morning, also some database poking for obs UUID's for Stuart, and working on fixing the mobile environment which got weird... Met with Sheldon for some pair programming in the afternoon also which went well. Really long, nice lunch run :p</p>
            <p class="entry" date="November 29">Last day before being gone for a while! Worked on answering an email to Brad which took some thinking, then worked again on fixing mobile on QA (this time with Dru), worked on some mobile refactoring with Dru which seemed to go reasonably well, and alos looked ahead to a little of Dru's work for the upcoming week while I'm gone (so stoked to be gone).</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 9">First day back in a while! Lots to catch up on, spent a long time just in emails. Also meetings. Some brainstorming bugs and things, and interfacing with Brad about some of his work on the PWL issues (which resulted in a fair bit of sysadmin fiddling for us... wooo).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 10">Some little bits of meetings here or there, but mostly pair-programming with Dru. Most of the morning was on the shitty Workflow code de-bugging freeform special email distribution stuff. Patches in the middle of the day, and then mobile work for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 11">Nothing too interesting... Meetings, meetings, meetings. A little bit of pair-programming with Dru on some little bugs n' issues here and there (mostly on mobile). End of the day, thought experiments about what a trigger with no result means... Huh. Staff party at night!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 12">Morning: Dru in late, 2 SOLID hours cranking away on the mobile app (with good results in modal refactoring). Middle of the day was making fixes for some new UI bugs we're seeing as a result of a Chrome update. Implemented fixes, and somewhat frantically released in the afternoon. That's about it...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 13">Pretty medium day... Got in some pair-programming with Dru in the AM in between database switching tasks for Stu's testing. Some meetings with Stu. Afternoon was spent trying to clean up the Enter Obs Page component, but I actually couldn't do it :'( So sad...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 15">Short day working from home... Just diagramming possible solutions to the Enter Obs Page cleanup work, and a half-hour call with Luke!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 16">Late start (went to the dump). Morning memail catchup, then planning meeting with Stuart (long conversation about restarts... hmm...). Afternoon, some QA deployments and checking on Jess' WX code, but mostly marching on with Enter Obs Page component refactor (It's time...).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 18"> Welp, last full day before leaving. Tried to fully tie up the refactor, but didn't quite finish all of it... Close, though. Also released some Jess code to QA, got some obs UUID's for stuart out fo the database, fixed a quick bug in the mobile app, weekly meetings, and a bit of misc. IT this n' that.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 19">Last day before being real gone for a while... Wrapped up a couple pull requests, handled a couple emails... That's about it! Only 3 hours today.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="December 30">Short day, just drove stright to work from Calgary and was very tired. Mostly just caught up on emails and recent crashes and things like that. Talked a bit with Dru and Stuart about Jira tickets and things. It was a short one...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="December 31">Ugh. Still chained to the fart of a fart that is our legacy system... Just reading lots of logs and trying to figure out what to do about some recent crashed... We deployed some half-finished Brad code to QA for some reasonably rigorous testing and it went well. More meetings to plan what to do about all this... Oh my. Also worked a little on documenting attachment submission (not going very well...)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 2"></p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 3"></p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 7">Pretty normal day. Long morning meetings, some sysadmin deploying Brad work to QA, some development on newly found bugs, some patchy-patchy time, a bit of pair programming with Dru, and more meetings.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 8">Arrived a little late because skiing, woo! Meetings, meetings, meetings, and then a little bit of seriously heinous debugging in callback-hell with Dru. The office was so loud we had to give up a few times... ugh. Late night taking care of the CPD videos.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 9">Pretty quiet day! Got a lot of good development planning done in the AM, plus some pair-programming with Dru, and a little more dev in the afternoon... So productive without the endless, hypochondriac meetings!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 11">Short lil' session catching up on reported bugs, error investigating, and email threads after an unexpectedly long ski tour...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 13">Mondays... Oof. Mostly just nursing the legacy client - considering new releases, fixing bugs, estimating Jira tickets, and deploying stuff to QA. Blarg.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 14">More fun in legacy-land... Arrived late to a release (bad move, Ben), and assisted with our gnarly branching situation, as well as a hotfix soon thereafter. Had a meeting with Kenny (solid). More legacy work, some planning meeting, a bit of mobile dev, some Xplorenet hounding, and looking at photos of Kristin's new kitten (amazing!).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 15"></p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 20">A hectic and highly reactive day. Spent pretty much all day looking into some overnight failures in API submission from CMH, as well as frantically testing and releasing our latest version in the Swedish and International environments. Pretty much 100% sysadmin... Fun...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 21">Kinda slow, actually... Stuart was gone in the morning, so we didn't spend hours in the morning looking into whatever happened in the AWS monitoring that morning (we still did in the afternoon when he arrived - harmless as usual). Dru and I did a little pair-programming on the mobile app with mixed results. I was feeling really slow and dumb, had a bad headache. Ended the day with some sysadmin working on getting some more code n' stuff up to QA for Stuart, as well as doing a little work estimating some outstanding Trello cards for mobile.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 22">Pretty normal day. Things are really quietting down on the legacy client. Meetings, meetings, meetings. Worked a little on researching CI and containers. Afternoon - met with Sheldon about validation and he had some great ideas that Dru and I spent the rest of the afternoon hacking on!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 23">Such a quiet day. Meeting with Stuart in the morning about how to take care of things while he's away next week. Rest of the day was just mobile dev - mostly working on the validation stuff. Rad.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 26">Well... Got some done today. Reviewed a few Jira tickets; resolved one and added a comment to another that isn't really defined yet. Also worked on some mobile development, made a little progress on validation and partly deferred another card there as well. Also did a little bit of general admin, catching up on email, and sysadmin, looking into those auto-deploy scripts for mobile (ugh!)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 27">Spent THE ENTIRE morning through 'til noon responding to Stuart's emails while he's away. Wowzers... Afternoon, did some development with Dru, as well as a bit of general IT office clean up.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="January 29">Weeeeeeeednesday. Programmed with Dru a bit, attended a few meetings, responded to more Stuart email, and did a lil' bit of transceiver practice with Brent, Dru and Andrea :) Also chopped away on the validation stuff a little while longer. Fun...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="January 30">Pooooo... Programmed a few hours in the morning until noon and then the entire afternoon was spent responding to emails, and a nightmarish call from Krista at CB (barf). Also reviewed Dru's latest PR. Solid code!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 1">Slow Saturday werkin' from home. Tried to work a full 8 hours but just absolutely couldn't keep my head in the game. Responded to a bunch of Stuart emails, and did about an hour of development, but that's about it...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 2">Had a little extra time to respond to Stuart emails, so spent a couple hours doing that (with a little bit of database sleuthing resulting).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 3">Stu's back! Spent the majority of the day chipping away at de-bugging the new validation code (getting much closer). Also had a long meeting with Stuart recapping events from his absence and how to bulk-import locations. Also rummaged in the basement for an extra monitor for Emily, and looked into KnowBe4 stuff since we got a billing notification this morning.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 4">Should've recorded this yesterday... I think a fair bit of mobile dev, some catching Stuart up, reviewing tomorrow's RI renewal plan, and a quick trip to to bank around lunch.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 5">Spent the entire day until 1 either responding to an email from Neil at CMH or in meetings (or reporting to Stuart). Lots of meetings, and a little bit of mobile dev in the afternoon.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 6">Mostly a dev day. Ugh, filling this in a few days late again and I can hardly remember... Looks like I checked in a bunch of edits on mobile. Did some work on attachments, I think? Can't remember the rest, I suppose...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 8">Just a half day from home working on mobile. Made some progress on attachments and commented out some future work, responded to some lengthy and confusing emails from CMH-Neil and Ben Shaw, and they addressed some of Stuart's comments in a few of the Trello cards on mobile.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 9">Just an hour from home doing a lil' sysadmin catchup.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 10">Monday, monday, monday... Oof. Kinda just feels like I was in a giant, infinite, run-on meeting with Stuart and Dru all day. Talked a lot about upcoming infrastructure work, as well as what's going on in general and who's doing what... Not sure I really did any concrete work today. I guess we did a couple releases? Huh...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 15">Just smashed out a bunch of little, outstanding, mobile development tasks for 8 hours. Pretty solid! </p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 16">Responded to some Stuart emails now that he's away, dealt with some outstanding admin tasks with my hours tracking and logging and such, worked a little more on that stupid frickin' InfoEx alternative page that's supposed to be so easy with S3, and tinkered a little more with the mobile attachments work. Blarf.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 17">Mostly a ski day, luckily no InfoEx emergencies while out at MacP :) Just spent an hour in the evening catching up on emails (personal and Stuart).</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 19">Started out at 5:30AM in a meeting at Selkirk Tangiers which went very well! Morning at office was catching up on Stuart emails and working a bit with Dru on combing our access logs for CMH data (although he pretty much had that all dialed in). Meetings, meetings, meetings. Then left early to book it to the Rockies with Joe and Swantje!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="February 24">Oh Monday's... Oof. Long, long, long meetings catching Stuart up and planning work n' such. Did some general IT getting things set up for the new bookkeeper, and a little sysadmin getting things ready for Stuart to test. Talked about more work with Dru, and did about an hour of dev on mobile attachment stuff. Fuuun...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 25">Blarf. So much sysadmin... Did a bunch of branch wrangling and tagging and versioning and releasing for testing prior to the real release planned for tomorrow. Also worked more on the maintenance page, which I just can't get to fuckin' work... Damnit AWS?? Anyhow... Also overhead a lot of Stuart's conversation with Will about maybe working for us in the even that NIF pulls through? Oh, and I had a meeting with Sheldon for a bit about versioning in the mobile app too. That's about it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 26">Meetings, meetings, meetings... Release didn't go great this morning, had some weird "index out of bounds" errors that caused issues... Ugh. Oh well. Meetings, meetings, meetings. Then a little mobile development, just chipping away at some of the stuff getting tossed back by Stuart and Sheldon.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="February 27">What a frickin' day... Lots of issues with IT and merge conflicts. Left super frustrated. Just logging this as I'm getting back to work 4 days later and I can only remember the shitty stuff now... Not quite sure what all else happened...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="March 3">First day back after the lil' Yoho non-adventure weekend. Endless morning meeting about tons of stuff... A little sysadmin finding some users, monthly backups, and stuff. Mid-day merge conflict resolving. Last few hours were working on the mobile attachments feature, which seems like it's finally coming together since I've got Redux involved now!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 4">Oh Wednesdays... Tons of meetings (duh). Ended the day pair-programming on the submit-all button on mobile. Also fiddled with Andrea's monitor a while, and Alex's holiday calendar subscription... Meh. Not that much.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 5">Honestly can't say I did anything that useful today... We did the Git migration, renamed some repositories, ran the monthly patches, and then spent 5 fucking hours trying to get a dev server running in VS Code... Fuck this fucking app. </p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 6">Super short day, just 2 hours before going to Kelowna to get Jess. Worked a little more on researching AWS Linus EOL and Vagrant (for Dru), and a little more dev environment fiddling.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 7">Working from home. Made paper prototypes of the new attachments upload stuff for our meeting Monday, worked for a few hours on trying to containerize our legacy apps (some successes..), documented setting up a dev environment in VS Code, and kept chopping a bit on the new dev environment.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="March 9">Mondays... Long morning chatz with Stu n' Dru. This time about local dev, containerization, and such. Spent some time on sysadmin migrating the Auto-WX middleware to BitBucket and doing a lil' debuggin on the mobile app validation stuff. Meeting about attachments paper prototype with Sheldon and crew. Then still trying to figure out how to get a local Tomcat development environment running.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 10">Short half-day before heading out on vacation. Just chopping away on some mobile bugs mostly</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="March 19">First day working from self-isolation. Purchased Archiva RI w/ Stuart, released some new Jess changes, looked into some API issues Ben found (deep rabbit hole!), met with Dru about some validation solutions (he's got some good ideas!), did a little bit more testing research, and a tiny bit of mobile dev.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 20">Another one from home. Morning meetings. Responded to Ben and released a fix for their KML/API access issues (it works!). Worked with Dru on trial-ing a containerized microservice for serving up constants (a good experiment). Also interfaced about some weird React-y stuff Dru had some questions about. Not super productive...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 21">Splitting the day into morning and afternoon. Super productive morning... Finally got kinda wired while working on the attachments stuff and made some real progress. Nice to see that coming along! Also getting re-assigned by Stuart to look into Brad/Steve's auto-WX issues (barf...).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 22">Just worked a couple hours in the morning. Wrote a briefing and implemented a demo of some improved server logging ideas.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 23">Solid day. Morning React reading, then meeting, then some attachments dev, followed by more crappy Auto-WX debugging (jeeze, Steve...), and finally a long pair-programming session with Dru on some of the improved validation stuff.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 24">Ooof. Not my most productive day. Really hitting a road block with some of the attachments work. Bummed to be stuck at home with no one to bounce ideas off of. Anyhow, had a couple little meetings, and spent a bit of time in the afternoon interfacing with Stuart and Dru about some of the issues they were working through - Dru on mobile dev, Stuart on his re-creating of Dru's local dev environment setup.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 25">Wednesday... Blarf... Meetings, meetings, meetings. Not super productive. Met with a few people about differn't stuff... Ugh so bored. Called it a day early for the nice weather outside.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 26">Just so blah... So stuck on this stupid frickin' Redux bug. FFFFFUUUUUUU!!!! I don't think I checked in any code today. WTF.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 27">Kinda just fucked off for most of the morning. Meeting. THEN I FINALLY CRACKED THE CASE! The attachment stuff is moving again at long last... Woo.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="March 30">Stupid dumb Monday's... Super tedious morning meeting where the communication just was not working (technologically or interpersonally). Protracted dry-run of a release scheduled for tomorrow... Kinda just a fart, really. Did a little bit of productive coding in the morning, though. Woop de do...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="March 31">Programmed a little in the morning. Then did a bunch of releases with an awkward break in the middle that wasn't quite long enough to get much done on the programming front :/ Interfaced with Dru a little in the afternoon about some bugs he's working on.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 1">Programming in the morning. Then meetings, meetings, meetings with no real work time in between :/ Completed the Jira/Confluence backups and patched all the leftover peripheral systems. Worked with Dru a bit in the afternoon on the Wiki that was apparently found out to have been hacked while I was away. How did that never come up?</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 2">Kinda just spent the entire day banging my head against a wall over this attachments crap... Spent a while on a call with Dru, connected with Sheldon, no luck yet. Page, after page of Google results for the errors. WTF.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 3">After another hour or two I finally solved the attachments crap mystery. Then worked on debugging little issues that came up subsequently, as well as styling some of the things. Eventually got the stuff up on QA but the attachments are coming back empty.... Hm...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 4">Short Saturday morning working from home - just worked on the empty attachment files with fresh eyes, which all went a little better this morning than last night. Got pulled away early by Jess and her cooking extravaganza :o</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="April 6">Pretty slow day... Not much work available to do :/ Met in the morning, reviewed some code, thought a lot about a testing plan... Meh. Not a ton going on.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 7">What a frickin' fart... Spent almost an hour and a half in the morning not doing anything because the team was on the brink of starting a meeting for ages... Had a really unproductive meeting about automated testing (not much input at all from the team). Then had a long, awkward, and somewhat typically vindictive interaction with Stuart about his excessively complicated email test that I don't want to be a part of... Wrote a few Jest tests near the end of the day.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 8">Wednesday... Spent a good chunk of the morning writing and de-bugging some more tests. Then meetings, meetings, meetings on and on forever... Finally spent the last few hours of my day after all the meetings working on the attachments stuff and consulting with Dru on some tricky UI bugs that were giving him a hard time.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 9">Morning - some testing work, then meeting, then some pair-programming to wrap up the validation stuff, and finally a little more testing work. Oh, and a little branch management in the middle...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="April 11">Meh... One of those days. Worked a while on trying to get some new tests running, but blah... Tried to make some useful notes on Stuart's "WTF do we do next???" question. Wrote a couple tests. Also made a prototype of some obs ID ideas? Meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 12">Ugh... I wanted so badly to hit 40 hours this week, but just couldn't muster the strength. So bored and un-motivated. Only got 2 hours in.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 13">Kind of an action packed Monday... Got caught in meeting-limbo for a while in the morning. Then had our nearly-3-hour project planning meeting. Did a little dev and brainstorming in the afternoon.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 14">'Nother long one. A little test development, then another sort of long team meeting. Spent some time brainstorming project-planning ideas. Ended the day with a little mobile dev (flexbox bugs) and reviewing Stuart's PR</p>
            <p class="entry" date="April 15">Wowzers.... So long. Planning meeting for a few hours in the morning, then a suuuuper boring staff meeting. Awkward time to kill. Then a crazy long Duck meeting where we walked back almost everything we talked about in the AM. Then a lil' meeting with Dru checking on a bug together. Finally wrapped up the day reading the MOTI docs from Tanya and catching up on hours tracking.</p>
