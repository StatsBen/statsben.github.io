        <h2>A daily record of Ben's work with the CAA in 2018</h2>
        
        <div id="content">
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 13">First Day! Got a tour of the office, started setting up dev environment, and ran through a few initial administrative things.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 14">Started suuuper early at the Eagle Pass Heli morning meeting. Cool to see a user with custom workflows, but also fascinating to see how much of their work is still offline. They were still reporting seasonal weather observations by hand with a chart on the wall, and most of their decisions were made offline just by breezing through the list of recent avalanches... Fascinating! I also finally got the dev environment up and running, but without a new-ish copy of the database! So that was cool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 15">Bit of a slow day after the long one yesterday, but I got a local copy of the database running (bit of a Postgres nightmare), finished the cybersecurity training, and started on my first project &#8212; adding server side validation of inputted data.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 16">Very short day, leaving early to get to Vancouver this weekend. Kept improving the validators, and ported this little record-keeping website over from my old SPIN work.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 20">Got the new computer all set up with the dev environment (much faster this time), and ticked off some administrative tasks. Checked in on Audrey regarding some Office 365 help (all resolved), and scratched the surface of the Avalanche Observation Validator class.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 21">Made a ton of progress on the Avalanche Observation validator! Finished as many checks as I could find, then had a code review with look and found some more having to do with what values an input can take based on some enumerations found elsewhere in the code base.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 22">Made a tiny bit more progress on the Avalanche Observation validator, but mostly spent the day at the Revy Tech Summit presenting on behalf of the CAA :)</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 23">Started working on a couple new tasks &#8212; handling validation errors in the UI, and documenting the submission of certain kinds of observations for CMH. Very buggy, slow, day, but I managed to stub out some solid progress right before leaving!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 26">Mostly just kept chugging on those validators... The UI bit that shows the validators as toasts is resolved, I think. So that's cool! And I'm probably 75% done with the Avalance Observation Validator.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Feb 27">Slightly more exciting day than normal! I successfully helped someone recover a password in Outlook using my admin access, got all set up with a YM account, helped Kristin fix some quirky html-email problems, and then (finally) finished the Avalanche Observation Validator. Yay!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 2">Cranked out some more work on the Avalanche Observation Validator, shadowed Luke while he completed some of the ongoing monthly tasks, and had a good code review that indicated more work needs to be done on the validators :/ meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 3">Actually really productive! Got a ton of coding done on the validators. Nothing exciting, but just chugged through a lot of work that needed doing.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar5">Pretty productive half-ish day! Mostly worked on the ONeDrive issue on Emily's computer, but also cranked out a little of the validator stuff... Solid, but short!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 6">Not a wildly productive day, but hard to quantify. Started out wrapping up the Weather Observation Validator (although I haven't gotten to test it yet), and then spent the rest of the day reading docs and exploring the Photo Overlay tool! I took a lot of notes on what I think about it, and read a little into its documentations, and also took a look at what it's doing in the web inspector... Lots of thoughts for the future!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 7">Today was a little slow... Luke and I chatted a bit about AWS' hosting services and what's all in there. I'm actually writing this note 3 days late becasue I just found out that I skipped my notes on this day, and I can't remember very well what I did :| Bummer....</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 8">A pretty short day, but interesting! I went through and viewed almost every shot-sheet that's been submitted to InfoEx to see how people are currently using the photo overlay tool, and it's pretty fascinating. Took a lot of notes, and got some good ideas of what users are up to. Drew a few sketches for interface ideas, and called it a day at 2!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 9">Another short day, but pretty productive. Did a lot of work for Jill and Brent on some email templates that'll go out before the spring conference, and they seem pretty happy with the results. I also did a little searching into possible mockup tools for prototyping, but there's nothing good for free :/ Finally, I tracked down all the JS that's currently running the photo editor, so I've got some great leads on places to start hacking on Monday!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 12">Solid day rocking away at the photo overlay drawing tool! Worked very hard, but unsuccessfully to craft a way to test the drawing tool with local images (the images can't be returned as blobs from the server in the local environment). Also did some email template work for Jill et. al.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 13">Interesting day! Mostly spent working on the same local testing issue for the overlay tool and email template, but went out to RMR for a site visit in the afternoon! Collected some excellent observations by looking overy their shot sheets, which I think will make our final product much better. Not to mention, it's just so fascinating observing users... They do the darndest things!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 14">Short day :( left early with some kind of strange fever-y sickness. Nevertheless, made some progress on the photo overlay testing environment, and did quite a bit more email template work for Brent, Jill, Kristin, and Jill.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 15">Another short day of being sick :( Big event today was helping Kristin get the conference email invite sent out! I learned a lot about html emails and what css works or doesn't. The next release will be better!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 16">Productive day! Wrapped up 2 more email templates for Jill (hopefully YM doesn't ruin them), mostly finished a solution to the type checking errors that bubble up from the server during validation of observations, and got some good info to help me get started on documenting the hazard assesment and snowpack assesment workflow modules! Very solid!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 21">Short day... I am so stumped on this photo overlay task! The legacy code is just SO hard to read. It's almost like multiple versions were implemented, but only one is even used. It's like following the wiring in a booby-trapped house where half the wires don't actually connect to anything! Somewhat flustered, taking off early...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 22">Another short one, slightly more productive than the last! Still pretty stumped on that darn photo overlay code. I just can't seem to figure out how it's all working, and I'm very frustrated. Anyhow, I switched over to the validator-y stuff branch and tied that all up! Resolved a sneaky bug that I hadn't noticed before, and got a start on encrypting my hard drive which I've been putting off way too long.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 23">Intense day! Maybe I drank too much coffee. Finally realized it's time to just dive in and start creating some new files and classes to make this whole photo overlay editor work... Had a lot of little things pop up today, mostly with Emily and radios. Got a lot done, totally wired, kinda wish I could stay and work a little longer on the photo editor!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Mar 24">Woo! Finally making some headway on the photo editor. Had the office all to myself, and got some very solid, serious programming cranked out. One of the most productive days I've had in weeks!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 3">First day back after a loooong bout of the flu! Hacked away at the photo overlay tool and made good progress. Go Ben.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 4">Started the day off with a site visit at Selkirk Tangiers, which was fascinating as always! One of the lead guides, Bob, spoke at leangth about how he doesn't really believe in the digital tools as he feels they get in the way of actually talking about the observations, and favour activities that work towards standardizing. S/T hates the bubbles! Other than that we had a staff meeting, and then I cranked out some more work on the photo overlay tool.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 5">Drank coffee and got a whole lot of stuff done on the photo overlay tool! Mostly worked on getting the zoom functionality running while keeping the whole "canvas-y" vibe. Also, Luke and I met briefly about the validators and reviewed a pull request resulting in a list of to-do's for early next week.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 7">Such a meh day :/ just couldn't get my brain to get any work done, so I decided it'd be better to save the CAA money and head home. Was in the office around 2 hours... Ugh.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 9">Solid day! Felt nice to come back and actually get something done after Saturday :) (see above). Today, I worked almost exclusively on resolving the comments attached to the pull request for all the validator stuff. Additionally, however, I chatted with Luke about possible solutions to the buggy photo editor, met with Kristin/Brent/Andrea about the upcoming spring conference, and started researching better solutions to the buggy photo overlay photo loading software. Long day!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 10">Darn... I forgot to log this day, and coming back to catch up a few days late I'm struggling to remember exactly what I was up to. I think, mostly implementing a new solution to the photoEditor tool using the "sessionStorage" API, as opposed to the "message" API.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 11">Very productive day! Helped run the Skype-related stuff for the weekly meeting in which we chatted about the upcoming conference. I then resolved some really pesky bugs in the existing photoEditor.html file that allowed me to finally hit the ground running and implement the "zoom" tool for the new editor as well as get the "canvas" element up and running! Ended the day with beers with Kristin and Brent.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 12">A medium day... Resolved a few more issues in the validators, but started working on the error handler for invalid types on the server and the brain just isn't having it.... Headed out early, will tackle fresh with coffee another day soon!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 14">Kind of a meh day :/ Working a little slow, somewhat easily distracted. Anyhow, I worked on the issue with the validators when an incorrect type is submitted, and I just can't find a good solution to this issue where the handler is in one class that needs to be extended, but some of the validators extend another class... Arg :/ Such a big Java problem.... Implemented a hacky solution and upgraded some front end code for displaying the errors, but ultimately not too happy with the solution...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 15">SOLID day... Had the office all to myself and plowed through a solid chunk of the photo editor which is shaping up nicesly :) Made some excellent progress on the point marking tool. Woo!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 16"> Decent day :) Luke was back, which was a nice change of pace, and we managed to find a pretty solid solution for the issue on Apr 14th with the Spring extension class blah blah blah... And I implemented point marking in the shot sheet editor, yay!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 17">Got a lot done! Implemented a method to handle page resizes in the photo editor, finished up those sneaky validators, met with Luke about some development procedures n' stuff, and did a bit of email template work for Jill. Got a bit of a late start after thinking of a new idea for this time tracking stuff I'm doing here...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 18">A flurry of meeting activity prepping for the AGM, a burrito, and then nap time :/ meh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 19">A slightly shorter day, leaving around 1:30 for and apartment viewing. Started the day with a very uneventful online seminar about data security for non-profits that was waaaaay too basic :/ Also got the mouse interactions up and running in the shot sheet editor for avalanche drawing, though, so that's cool!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 20">Long day! Put in quite a few hours. Implemented a quick avalanche drawing tool, but then found a bug in the way that zoom offset was being calculated, so I spent a little too much time tracking that down :/ Met with Luke and Stuart, mostly chatted about the possibility of some charting tool changes, and eventually wrapped up the day with a last check on the validator pull request which should be all good to go now!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 21">Phew... This is a lot of days of work in a row... Nevertheless, I've finally resolved that darn stupid zoom offset bug in the shot sheet editor, implented a very simple avalanche drawing tool, and the first little sketchy bit of a "free-form draw" tool. Started early, leaving early. nice....</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 22">V short day, only 3 hours, but I cranked out some major progress on the shot sheet editor! I love having the office all to myself!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 24">Pew, pew! Killin' it today! Implemented avalanche colour coding, size and colour for free-draw, a hacky undo feature, added a Pusheen-y easter egg, and stubbed out a labelling tool for points. Awesome! This editor is really coming together!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 25">Ugh... No sleep, and no productivity. Got a little bit of work done adding ski cuts to the editor, joined in on the weekly meeting, and left the office early. Meh...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="Apr 26">Solid day! Biggest thing was sorting out all the tech setup for the AGM. Other than that, polished up a few things in the shot sheet editor and implemented the ski cut feature, and got a rudimentary version of point labelling up and running. woo!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 10">Phew! Finally back from the Spring Conference whirlwind tour! Had the 3 month review with Luke today, did some template work for Jill, and started working on connecting up the shot sheet editor prototype to the original code. Not too bad!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 11">A little on the short side, but reasonably productive. Finished another email template for Jill, reviewed some future work with Luke that I'll try to tackle while he's away, and (with some help from Luke) got the photo editor pulling up real InfoEx photos locally!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 14">Sloggy day... It's hot as balls in the office, and the brain is running slow! Anyhow, did a bit of email template work and resolved an issue with the FS object not being created becuase the Network.js file is so long that its ready function was being appended after that of other scripts listed much later in the html file. Meh.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 15">Got the AJAX authentication working in the new photo editor! Wooooo... Also did a bit of email template work for Jill.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 16">Short day before heading out to meet Andrei, but got had the weekly meeting and then started doing a bit of work on the photo viewer, but there's a strange error coming up that I don't quite understand yet...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 17">Sloggy day... Brain not working well. Wrote a call-out for a mentor from the IT committee, kept hammering away at the photo viewing tool (with little success), chatted with Luke who's leaving soon, and went home a bit on the early side.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 18">Still running a little slow, but made some solid progress on the photo viewer so the sizing is optimized, and the thumbnails are more usable. Not too bad... It's real quiet in here...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 19">Blarg... Such a slow day! Brain not running right. Started working on the zoom tool for photo viewing, but it's just not going well. Many properties of the images just don't work as intended because of the way this window is hackily opened with no html... No serious progress.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 20">Got back from a run and saw some Mail Gun erros, so I popped over to Dose for some coffee and hopefully solutions! Submitted a trouble ticket per Luke's instructions, so hopefully that gets better. Started working on the photo viewer tool, and quickly realized that probably wasn't a great idea in a coffee shop where anyone can look over my shoulder... Meh, oh well. Later, at home, finished up the photo viewer. It's amazing what a change of space and some good coffee can do!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 22">Very blah day... Maybe still recovering from all the climbing yesterday. Anyhow, resolved an email about DNS stuff for caaml.org, caught up on email, made a pull request for the photo viewer work, and tried really hard ot get stuff done on the shot sheet editor but kinda floundered.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 23">Logging this a week later because I just realized this day was forgotten :/ bummer. But if memory serves I looked into some photo viewing for Stuart so he could respond ot a user inquiry, and set up things for the weekly meeting, helped Pam the printer lady do some work, and then I think I made a few hotfixes on the shot sheet editor based on conference feedback? hm...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 25">Just an hour of pesting Mailgun to do their job remotely...</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="May 28">Slow day. Did a bit of work on the shot sheet editor starting to get the doodles to save, but realized there's some high-level thinking that needs to happen first about what reviewing those drawings will look like. Worked a little more on the ability to delete things from the shot sheets, but I'm getting a really weird but where functions 'don't exist' even though they totally do. Also tracked down some printer info because we need to re-open that trouble ticket, and did a bit more Mailgun pestering...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 29">Not a very productive day :/ Just not making headway on this photo editing stuff. Arg. Did some admin-esque work sorting Janis' Outlook account now that it's no longer needed, made a real quick email template for Jill, and... that's really about it.</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 30">Another meh day, but a bit more productive than yesterday. Attended the weekly meeting, and switched over to working on the pop-up history window issue which I'd say is a little over half resolved. There's a bit of odd stuff happening, but it's coming along nicely and should be done soon!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="May 31">Darn. Another slow one. Sorta made a bit of progress on the pop-up history window, but kinda just stared at the screen a lot... There must be dirt or sunscreen in my eye because I just can't keep it open, and that doesn't really help :/ Also had a quick chat with Kat about making some edits on the website, tried a bit of Audrey's tomato jam, and helped Andrea fix some titles in our YouTube videos from the recent conference. Not bad for a half day!</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 5">Did some solid work on migrating the historical view pop-up system to the session storage API, but also helped update some errors in our private YouTube channel with a new video from Doug, consulted to Audrey about HTML emails in the "Events" part of YM, and also helped our renters figure out what's up with their internet and why it doesn't seem to work that well. Lots of interesting, little hurdles today!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 6">Finally figured a good way to re-write the historical view pop-up system... Really, all the JS in the report-window.html file should be in the report-window.js to ensure it all happens in the right order. Will adjust accordingly tomorrow! Also spent some time helping Susan with her excel spreadsheet for the CARROT meeting, fielded some questions from Scott Wickson over the phone, attended the weekly meeting, and consulted to Andrea about some email things (info@avass.ca).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 7">Shoot... Forgot to log this day so I'm coming back to it later and can't remember a lot. I think I kept working on the historical pop-up view... mm... darn. I have to log these things day-of!</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 8">Another one I forgot to log. I remember being really zonked this day and feeling very sluggish and unproductive. I left early, it looks like, in my hours log.</p>
            
            <p class="entry" date="June 10">I get SO much done when no one is here (I mean, Myline was here, but it's different)! Cranked out some real solid work on the historical pop-up view, and left when I hit a road block. All the data timing is working now, but I've learned that JS can't modify elements on a "child window", so I'll need to do some brainstorming to finish this thang, which should be easier when Luke is back...</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 11">LAYERS PANEL!!!! Best idea... How did I not think of this before! Note to self. OK, now for the log... Started switchiing over to work on the SWAG validations after putting the historical-view pop-up on hold, but have had nothing but problems. Database columns are missing, Hibernate and Beans are throwing exceptions, they're showing up as toasts but not in the console... OOof. Also warded off some potential cyber-security threats in the form of fake emails sent to Kristin and Joe and resurrected my lost Outlook calendar (finally!!!).</p>
            <p class="entry" date="June 12">Luke's back! Hooray! Spent the day working on the new layers panel feature idea. Stubbed some new classes and got the bare bones of a few UI elements up and running. Also had the party-planning committee meeting! That was cool! :D</p>
