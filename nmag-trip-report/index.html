class="c4 c13"><h2 class="c11" id="h.dn9kre3okh4e"><span class="c2">Intro</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>From March 2nd to 17th of 2019, Ben Clark and Jess Landing went winter climbing in Scotland thanks to the generous support of the wonderful Neil MacKenzie Adventure Grant. </span><span class="c4">Their two week journey made a clockwise circuit beginning in Glasgow, West through Glen Coe, along the coast at Fort William (with a side trip to Ben Nevis), through the Isles at Skye, North to Torridon, East to Inverness, up high to Cairn Gorm, and finally back down to Glasgow. Th</span><span class="c0">ere were many fantastic snacks along the way as well, including numerous Full Scottish Breakfasts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, due to the record-setting warm weather in February 2019, by the time of the trip the largest piece of naturally-occurring ice in all of Scotland couldn&rsquo;t have been taller than 10cm. In short, no ice climbing was possible. Winter made a grand resurgence come March, though, and despite the lack of climbable ice, plenty of snow, cold, and adventure were found and enjoyed during the trip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our journey is discussed in 6 short stories below, each told by either Ben or Jess, with snide commentary from the other to be found in parenthesis throughout. Once again, we can&rsquo;t overstate our thanks to the MacKenzie family, the Trust, and the UBC Varsity Outdoors Club, their kind support and enabling of the two of us to live out our dream trip. We would encourage anyone else who has an interest in seeing more of Scotland to apply for the grant - we hope our stories demonstrate that you don&rsquo;t have to be the hardest crushing climber, you just have to have fun (and yes, sometimes in 80mph winds)!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.1wkmtr36yrdk"><span>Ben Nevis (Ben)</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was our first day of climbing on the trip, and with the best forecast the Highlands would see over the next two weeks, we jumped straight onto Ben Nevis, by way of the Cairn Mor Dearg Arete. In the midst of a downpour, we left Glen Nevis just before sunrise and by the time we arrived at the saddle, we were already slogging through boot-high slush and a whole lot of sheep feces (not an improvement).</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: Jess below Ben Nevis on the way into Coire Leis</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Nevertheless, we crossed over the pass and down into Coire Leis below the giant North East Face of the Ben. </span><span>To our right, gigantic, snow-dusted cliffs disappeared up into the clouds above. B</span><span>y the time we passed the CIC Hut graupel stung our faces and the wind was so strong it could have toppled a sheep; but </span><span>we carried on, up into</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the coire</span><span class="c0">, the snow deepening steadily along the way.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>We deviated from the standard Cairn Mor Dearg route due to avalanche conditions. Rather than taking the easiest route up a gentle snow slope to our right, our detour took us left. </span><span class="c4">We tackled the blocky face at the back </span><span class="c4">of the coire</span><span class="c0 c4">&nbsp;head on, going directly to the lowest point of the ridge, the vertex of the curve that stretches lazily from Cairn Mor Dearg to Ben Nevis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we climbed higher to the steepest part of the little face, we were quickly immersed in true Scottish winter climbing. Terrifying at first, but with a little knowledge of how to play the game it was actually kind of fun. There are few comforts as great as the sound of an ice axe sinking firmly into a frozen clod of sod. It&rsquo;s like the sound of someone tearing the corner off of a piece of paper, superimposed on a faint thud. We moved slowly up the little face, climbing over and weaving between giant, snowy boulders, finding perfect turf sticks in all the crevices. </span><span class="c12">[Jess: Personally, I was not as comfortable moving through this part of our climb. The degree of confidence Ben was finding in his sod sticks paralleled the magnitude of my nerves. Having had less time with my axes in the months prior than I would have liked, I was grateful for Ben&rsquo;s patience and tips in navigating the somewhat steep and slick terrain]</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: Jess climbing snow and frozen sod on the Cairn Mor Dearg arete.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty soon, we wallowed up through a snowdrift and plopped onto the Cairn Mor Dearg arete, only 400m from the top of Ben Nevis. As we carefully shimmied, scooted, slid, and scootched our way along the snowy ridge, the clouds were beginning to clear and the wind was getting quieter and quieter.

With a distance of 16 kilometres and an elevation gain of 1600 meters, we were looking at least a 9-12 hour day. A large objective, but with it only being a 15 minute drive from the hostel and the weather (potentially) in our favour, we screenshot a map, saved what we thought were detailed trip descriptions and were setting off from the trailhead by 8am. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c9">After a mere 15 minutes on trail, I realized we were on the wrong side of the river </span><span class="c12 c4 c9">[Ben: I disagreed]</span><span class="c4 c9">; so, we retraced our steps to the car, crossed a footbridge, and found the trail on the far side. The trail quickly shrank to barely a sheep&rsquo;s path and before long, we were slogging through knee deep muck and peat moss</span><span class="c12 c4 c9">&nbsp;[Ben: I repeat - I really, REALLY did not think this was the trail]</span><span class="c4 c9">. However, a quick check of the map confirmed we were headed in our intended direction. Sure, it didn&rsquo;t look like your typical &ldquo;well-traveled trail&rdquo;, but we&rsquo;ve all missed features that a guidebook has labelled &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; and after all, we were in the wilds of Scotland - how was I supposed to know what &ldquo;well-traveled&rdquo; meant in these parts?</span><span class="c12 c4 c9">&nbsp;[Ben: I thought the guidebook reported that hundreds of hillwalkers hike to the nearby waterfalls every year&hellip; Maybe a sign?]</span><span class="c4 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c9">Pretty soon, our &ldquo;faint-line-of-maybe-trodden-grass-and-mud&rdquo; crossed over a stream </span><span class="c12 c4 c9">[Ben: It was at least nice to wash the sheep feces out of my boot - hooray!]</span><span class="c4 c9">&nbsp;and took a sharp turn uphill. As we clambered up some precariously slick moss-covered roots and rocks, we soon found ourselves clinging to a slippery cliffside. After half a day of quintessential Scottish bog, we found ourselves halfway up the side of a sketchy hill, a cliff blocking any way forward, looking across the raging river below to see a few sheep walking along the perfectly manicured, well-defined trail, I had thought we were on, all on the opposite side of the river </span><span class="c12 c4 c9">[Ben: those lucky little sheep even had a steel suspension bridge over there!]</span><span class="c4 c9">. At any rate, we enjoyed some nice views of Steall Falls on our return, shared a good laugh over a cappuccino back in Fort William, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be all the wiser for it next time </span><span class="c4 c9 c12">[Ben: And for the first time that day, we actually agreed on something - it was quite funny and cappuccinos are fantastic]</span><span class="c8 c4">!</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 484.22px; height: 646.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 484.22px; height: 646.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">Above: Steall Falls as seen from our dead end up a cliff.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.ia04zdxyhcdr"><span>The Buachaille! (Jess)</span></h2><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c9">On our way to Fort William, we passed through Glen Coe, a beautiful expanse, dotted with classically Highland hills and one particularly prominent Munro. The top was dusted with snow and a grove of trees with a very cozy-looking cottage sat at its base - white walls, green </span><span class="c4 c9">roof</span><span class="c4 c9">, adorable. We later found out that this mountain was Buachaille Etiv Mor, one of the most loved of all the Scottish Munros. Wanting to climb it, we settled on a hiking route that traveled up the main coire, traversed along the various high points, and ultimately wrapped around and down the far side. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c9">Our third morning in Glen Nevis, we made the 45-minute drive down to Glen Coe </span><span class="c12 c4 c9">[Ben: twice, actually, due to a forgotten waterproof shell - essential!]</span><span class="c4 c9">. When we parked the car </span><span class="c12 c4 c9">[Ben: For a second time]</span><span class="c8 c4">, we were welcomed by some of the heaviest rain I have ever seen. An absolutely torrential downpour, rain drops blowing sideways - the kind of rain that makes lacing up our waterproof mountaineering boots and zipping up our coat that last thing you want to do. I think we made it about 45 minutes through the marsh, past the cottage (which we later learned is the Lagangarbh Hut, maintained by the Scottish Mountaineering Club), and up into the coire before the rain turned to snow, and our trail quickly disappeared. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c9">We slowly and deliberately made our way up the corie, gaining the ridge with the help of our axes on the final bit of steep slope and in full-white out conditions. We knew route-finding could pose a potential challenge at one specific point on the ridge, &ldquo;as the terrain has led some walkers to descend southeast from this point; note the turn in the ridge for the descent to the next bealach&rdquo;, quoted the ever-reliable Walk Highlands. Even with that foresight, the use of our GPX file, and the GPS on our phones, we made this exact mistake; taking us for some unnecessary winter down-climbing only to have to scramble back up. Silver lining: At this point, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I learned what it was to experience one of those secure frozen turf sticks Ben&rsquo;s always rambling on about </span><span class="c12 c4 c9">[Ben: I prefer a more loamy frozen sod, but to each their own!]</span><span class="c8 c4">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 464.50px; height: 619.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 464.50px; height: 619.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: Ben nearing the summit of Buachaille Etive Mor</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c9">After completing our traverse of the ridge (the correct one), we found the back coire, finally making our way down to mellowier weather and for the first time that day, the absence of any precipitation dripping down our backs.

I think I started one of my bits that way too! Does that happen a lot here?]</span><span class="c0">. We spent a rainy day driving from Glen Nevis to our next destination: the Isle of Skye. Here, we tracked down a local fisherman&rsquo;s hut and snacked on Scottish mussels and scallops, we walked around the picturesque seatown of Portree, and we settled into our Airbnb in the tiny &ldquo;town&rdquo; of Sligachan. Made up of a trailhead that leads into the Cuillin, a campground only open during the summer months, a two-in-one hotel and brewery, and a self-catering lodge (our Airbnb), calling it a town seems to oversell it. Nonetheless, the location was one of the most breathtaking of the trip and chock-full of charm: rolling hills, framed by the Red and Black Cuillin; lush, green, and peppered with the bubbling of the namesake river; the place we would call home for the next two nights, Sligachan, still remains one of my favourites from the trip. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>The next morning, we woke up and Ben very sick </span><span class="c12">[Ben: What a raging fever&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t stop shivering and woke up a few times thinking I was in the hull of a ship. I got to watch some BBC Alba, though, that was neat]</span><span class="c0">. Having discovered a few days prior that venturing to Sligachan would take us close to Bell&rsquo;s Bothy, I realized it would be a great opportunity to take advantage of some milder weather and see what kind of shape my running legs were in. With my running vest packed with electrolytes, stroopwafel, and an extra dose of tolerance for what was sure to be a classically Scottish, boggy trail, I left Ben a-snoozin&rsquo; and headed towards Bell&rsquo;s Bothy at Camasunary Bay. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: The Black Cuillin along the route to Camasunary Bay</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">The trail to Camasunary Bay is a flat, well-maintained, rocky trail that meanders down the long valley between the Red and Black Cuillin. Inspired by the absolutely breathtaking views, I decided to tack on a detour a nearby hill, Sgurr na Stri. Accompanied by three adventuresome sheep, a few snowflakes, and a whole lot of wind, the trail led me high up, overlooking the sea, the Bay, and the Bothy below. I opted to take the most direct line and descended down a dirty gully, making some moves I can most accurately describe as &ldquo;moss glissading&rdquo;, and ended up wading through a knee-deep brackish river, ultimately arriving at the beach and Bothy. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: The Black Cuillin from Sgurr na Stri</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>Sand under my feet (and now in my shoes), I made it over to the far side of the beach and took a few minutes to look inside the Bothy, admiring the selection of games in the common space, the immaculately swept floors, and the beautiful sign hung in Neil&rsquo;s honour. I remember feeling a bit of sadness because I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to enjoy a night at the Bothy, and I made a mental note that a return trip to Scotland would be needed in order to return here and to further explore the expansive Bothy network. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: View from Bell&rsquo;s Bothy, towards Camasunary Bay and Sgurr na Stri</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>Returning to Sligachan, this time by the more direct footpath, I passed my first fellow human adventurers of the day. For a round trip of 30 kilometers, seeing only four people during that time felt incredibly special.

So that&rsquo;s what happened while I was in bed all day&hellip;]</span><span>. Returning to the Airbnb, I found a well-rested and nearly recovered Ben. Naturally, I helped him put on all his coats and we hobbled over to the hotel&rsquo;s bar, enjoying pints of Porter-like ale that had been brewed just next door and two, very poorly played games of chess.</span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.o727odyc54k4"><span>Liathach (Ben)</span></h2><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">In spite of being barely 1,000m tall, I find the mountains in the far Northwest of Scotland look impossibly huge. The broad, glacially carved valleys offer such grand vistas, and the giant, icy, striated faces look like they&rsquo;re miles above treeline. Even people we spoke to in Inverness, Scotland&rsquo;s northernmost metropolis, seemed to think this was the ends of the earth, and it certainly felt that way to me. We stayed at the hostel in Torridon, nestled deep in the heart of this wild and remote range. Rising straight up behind the hostel is Liathach, a 1000m high mountain massif containing two Munros connected by a long, steep, narrow ridge with a series of towers called the Fasarinen Pinnacles. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">The forecast for our first day in Torridon predicted &ldquo;considerable buffeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;any mobility becoming increasingly tortuous throughout the day&rdquo;. But as we had learned so far on our trip, we had to keep tossing chips on the table if we ever hoped to win a hand. At dawn, we walked 3km down the &ldquo;highway&rdquo; (a single-lane road buried in a thick layer of sheep) to the East end of Liathach, in clear but windy conditions. As we walked, shaggy Scottish red deer watched us suspiciously from the deep shadows of a nearby pine grove. We found the trail and about an hour in, we started to find remnants of the previous night&rsquo;s thunderstorms. A thin glaze of verglas coated the cliffs in a dull sheen, and there were numerous patches of hail, some waist deep! These hail piles made for some of the most unique scrambling I&rsquo;ve ever come across, kind of like escaping an amusement park ball pit as a child.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4">We clambered up and over a few short steps and eventually scampered onto the crest of the ridge where we were greeted by incredible views of snowy, grand, and beautiful Beinn Eighe.

By this point in our trip, we had hoped that some wee trickles of ice would have fattened up into sheets just thick enough to hold an ice axe. Unfortunately, those golf balls falling down in Aviemore were falling even heavier high on Cairn Gorm. If there had been a trace of ice, by now it was certainly covered in a few feet of fresh snow.</span><span class="c0 c17">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, the following morning, lured by a break in the storm, we decided to take the ice tools for a walk to the historic Coire An t&rsquo;Sneachda. Since it was our final day of climbing, it was a really tough call to make, but upon arriving at the Coire, avalanche conditions were too severe for us to feel safe climbing our intended route. However, we decided there was still time for a little adventure and climbed up a small, wind-scoured ridge to the high Cairngorm Plateau, returning by an alternate route. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: Jess approaching Coire An t&rsquo;Sneachda</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">As we climbed, the wind picked up and the bits of ice and snow that our boots knocked from rocks, rather than falling downhill, would instead would go skittering uphill, blasting off over the ridge, where presumably they&rsquo;d land in Glasgow later that day. Once on top of that desolate plateau, it was hard to stay upright, and we could barely see 4 metres through the cloud and stinging ice crystals. After an hour or two of persistent staggering, troublesome route-finding, and the occasional crawl, our efforts brought us stumbling down off the plateau and back towards our hostel. This time, to recover from our ordeal, we grabbed a meal at the Mountain Cafe in Aviemore, and spent some quality time catching up with Jess&rsquo; aunt who had come to join us for our final night in the Cairngorms. A hot meal, by a warm fire, with gigantic snowflakes drifting gently outside the window - some of my fondest memories of the past winter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: Ben almost on top Cairn Gorm with Coire An t&rsquo;Sneachda in the background.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was bittersweet to end our trip without having climbed any ice, but that&rsquo;s the way it goes for us ice climbers some days. In a weird way, because we were forced to make things up as we went, I almost think we chose more fun adventures than we&rsquo;d have ever dreamt up at home. We learned a thing or two about winter hillwalking, scottish treats, Gaelic, hospitality, whiteout navigation, non-whiteout navigation, sheep, and maybe even ourselves. At any rate, it was certainly the most fun thing we did all winter, and the adventures are ones we&rsquo;ll never forget!</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.1q27u7dlw5k9"><span class="c18">Appendix - Extra Photos</span></h1><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Above: Gnarly trees and thick moss somewhere near Steall Falls&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12 c14">Above: A Highland Cow Jess was super stoked about.</span></p></body></html>
